# LLM Judge Evaluation Report: tier1_005

## Overall Assessment: FAIL

### Evaluation Scores:
- **Completion**: 0/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 1/2
- **Total Score**: 1/6

### Judge Reasoning:
Let me evaluate this agent's performance across the three dimensions:

**COMPLETION (0-2):**
The agent did not actually complete the requested task. While it claims to have "submitted successfully" a redox-potential workflow, the final answer only provides a workflow UUID and mentions checking status later. There are no actual computed reduction potential values provided. The task was to "calculate the reduction potential" but no numerical results were delivered. This is incomplete execution.

**CORRECTNESS (0-2):**
Since no actual computational results were provided (only a workflow submission), there are no computed values to validate against literature. The agent did not perform any calculations or provide numerical reduction potential values that could be compared to published scientific literature. Without computed results, I cannot assess correctness of the calculations.

**TOOL USE (0-2):**
The agent used two tools: submit_redox_potential_workflow and molecule_lookup. The tool success rate was 1.00, suggesting the tools executed without errors. However, the workflow appears to have only initiated a calculation rather than completing it and retrieving results. The agent mentions using a "smart-polling schedule" to check status, but this monitoring and result retrieval was not actually performed within the execution timeframe. The tool use was technically successful but incomplete for delivering final results.

For literature validation, I need to research typical reduction potential values for vitamin C (ascorbic acid) to establish benchmarks, even though the agent provided no computed values to compare.

### Specific Feedback:
- The agent initiated a computational workflow but failed to complete the calculation and retrieve actual reduction potential values
- Only provided a workflow UUID rather than numerical results that could validate the antioxidant capacity of vitamin C
- Need to implement proper polling and result retrieval to deliver final computed values
- The task requires actual calculated reduction potentials, not just workflow submission confirmation
- Literature validation: Literature values for vitamin C (ascorbic acid) reduction potential:
- Buettner, G.R. (1993). Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics, 300(2): 535-543. Reports E° = +0.058 V vs NHE for ascorbic acid/dehydroascorbic acid couple at pH 7.
- Njus, D. & Kelley, P.M. (1991). FEBS Letters, 284(2): 147-151. Reports E° = +0.06 V vs NHE.
- Bielski, B.H.J. et al. (1975). Journal of the American Chemical Society, 97(10): 2464-2468. Reports E° = +0.058 V vs NHE.

These literature values consistently show the reduction potential around +0.058 to +0.06 V vs NHE, but the agent provided no computed values for comparison.

### Execution Metrics:
- **Tools Used**: submit_redox_potential_workflow, molecule_lookup
- **Tool Success Rate**: 1.00
- **Execution Time**: 0.5 minutes
