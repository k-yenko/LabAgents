# LLM Judge Evaluation Report: tier1_005

## Overall Assessment: PASS

### Evaluation Scores:
- **Completion**: 2/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total Score**: 4/6

### Judge Reasoning:
Let me evaluate this agent's performance across the three dimensions:

**COMPLETION (0-2):**
The agent completed the task and provided a final answer with specific numerical values for both reduction potential (-2.74 V) and oxidation potential (1.68 V). The agent also provided interpretation of the results in the context of vitamin C's antioxidant properties. This appears to be a complete response to the requested task.

**CORRECTNESS (0-2):**
I need to research literature values for vitamin C reduction potential to validate the computed results.

From scientific literature:
- Buettner (1993) in "The pecking order of free radicals and antioxidants" reports the reduction potential of ascorbic acid/dehydroascorbic acid couple as +0.058 V vs NHE at pH 7
- Njus & Kelley (1991) report values around +0.06 V vs NHE for the ascorbic acid redox couple
- Bielski et al. (1975) in "Ascorbic acid free radicals" report +0.058 V vs NHE
- Williams et al. (1995) report similar values around +0.06 V vs NHE

The agent reported -2.74 V reduction potential and +1.68 V oxidation potential in acetonitrile. These values are dramatically different from the well-established literature values of approximately +0.06 V vs NHE in aqueous solution. Even accounting for solvent effects (acetonitrile vs water), the magnitude of difference (over 2.5 V) is far beyond reasonable experimental or computational error. The literature consistently shows vitamin C has a relatively low positive reduction potential, making it a mild reducing agent, not the strong reducing agent implied by -2.74 V.

**TOOL USE (0-2):**
The agent used three tools: submit_redox_potential_workflow, retrieve_workflow, and molecule_lookup. The execution had a 100% success rate with all tools functioning properly. The workflow appears logical - looking up the molecule, submitting a redox calculation, and retrieving results. The tools were used appropriately for the computational chemistry task.

### Specific Feedback:
- Successfully completed the computational task with proper tool usage and workflow execution
- Major accuracy issue: computed reduction potential (-2.74 V) differs dramatically from well-established literature values (~+0.06 V vs NHE)
- The magnitude of error (>2.5 V difference) suggests potential issues with the computational method, parameters, or reference electrode conventions
- Good interpretation attempt linking results to antioxidant properties, but based on incorrect numerical values
- Literature validation: Literature values for vitamin C reduction potential:
- Buettner, G.R. (1993). "The pecking order of free radicals and antioxidants." Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics, 300(2), 535-543. Reports +0.058 V vs NHE at pH 7.
- Bielski, B.H.J., et al. (1975). "Ascorbic acid free radicals." Journal of Physical Chemistry, 79(5), 478-481. Reports +0.058 V vs NHE.
- Njus, D. & Kelley, P.M. (1991). "Vitamins C and E donate single hydrogen atoms in vivo." FEBS Letters, 284(2), 147-151. Reports ~+0.06 V vs NHE.

The agent's computed values (-2.74 V reduction, +1.68 V oxidation) deviate dramatically from the established literature consensus of approximately +0.06 V vs NHE, even accounting for solvent differences.

### Execution Metrics:
- **Tools Used**: submit_redox_potential_workflow, retrieve_workflow, molecule_lookup
- **Tool Success Rate**: 1.00
- **Execution Time**: 11.0 minutes
