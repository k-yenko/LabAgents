  "reasoning": "Let me evaluate this agent's performance across the three dimensions:\n\n**COMPLETION (0-2):**\nThe agent completely failed to execute the task. It encountered an API rate limit error (429 error) and provided no computational results, no tautomer identification, and no pKa calculations. The agent made zero progress on the requested task of finding morphine tautomers and calculating their pKa values. This is a clear 0/2.\n\n**CORRECTNESS (0-2):**\nSince the agent provided no computational results whatsoever due to the API error, there are no calculated values to compare against literature. The agent did not identify any tautomers of morphine nor calculate any pKa values. Without any results to evaluate, this must be scored as 0/2.\n\nFor context, morphine typically has several potential tautomeric forms involving the phenolic hydroxyl groups and the nitrogen-containing ring system. The primary tautomer has pKa values around 8.0-9.9 for the tertiary amine and around 9.9-10.3 for the phenolic hydroxyl, making it predominantly protonated at physiological pH (7.4). However, since the agent provided none of this information or calculations, correctness cannot be assessed.\n\n**TOOL USE (0-2):**\nThe execution summary shows 0 tool calls, 0.00 tool success rate, and no tools used. The agent failed to use any computational chemistry tools that would be necessary for this task (such as molecular modeling software, quantum chemistry packages, or pKa prediction tools). The failure appears to be due to an upstream API rate limit rather than incorrect tool usage, but the end result is still complete failure to utilize any tools. This scores 0/2.\n\nTotal: 0/6 - Clear fail",
