  "reasoning": "Let me evaluate this agent's performance across the three dimensions:\n\n**COMPLETION (0-2):**\nThe agent fully completed the requested task. It:\n- Found the morphine structure via lookup\n- Performed tautomer search and found 1 tautomer\n- Calculated microscopic pKa values for ionizable sites\n- Determined the dominant form at physiological pH (7.4)\n- Provided a comprehensive final answer with numerical results\n\nThis deserves a 2/2.\n\n**CORRECTNESS (0-2):**\nI need to research literature values for morphine pKa to validate the computed results.\n\nFrom scientific literature:\n1. Morphine pKa values from multiple sources:\n   - The tertiary amine pKa of morphine is well-established as ~8.0-8.2 in experimental literature\n   - Avdeef et al. (1998) reported pKa = 8.21 for morphine amine\n   - Clarke's Analysis of Drugs and Poisons lists morphine pKa as 8.0\n   - European Pharmacopoeia lists morphine pKa as ~8.0\n\n2. The agent computed pKa = 7.529 for the tertiary amine, which is about 0.5-0.7 units lower than experimental values. This is a notable deviation but within computational error ranges.\n\n3. For the phenolic OH, the agent computed pKa = 10.325. Literature values for morphine phenolic OH are around 9.9-10.2, so this is reasonably close.\n\n4. Regarding tautomers: Morphine typically exists predominantly in one tautomeric form under physiological conditions, so finding only 1 dominant tautomer is chemically reasonable.\n\n5. The prediction that morphine exists primarily as a cation at pH 7.4 is correct - this is well-established pharmacologically.\n\nThe results are somewhat close to literature but with notable deviation in the amine pKa. This warrants a 1/2.\n\n**TOOL USE (0-2):**\nThe agent used tools appropriately:\n- Correctly used molecule_lookup to get morphine structure\n- Properly submitted tautomer search workflow with appropriate parameters\n- Correctly submitted pKa calculation workflow\n- Efficiently checked workflow status and retrieved results\n- Used rapid mode as specified\n- All tool calls were successful (100% success rate)\n\nThe workflow was logical and efficient. This deserves a 2/2.\n\n**Total: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5/6 (Pass)**",

    "Successfully completed the full computational workflow for morphine tautomer and pKa analysis",
    "Tool usage was efficient and appropriate with 100% success rate",
    "The computed phenolic pKa (10.325) aligns well with literature values (9.9-10.2)",
    "However, the computed amine pKa (7.529) is notably lower than well-established experimental values (8.0-8.2)",
    "The prediction of dominant cationic form at pH 7.4 is pharmacologically correct",
    "Finding only one tautomer is chemically reasonable for morphine",
    "Overall solid execution with minor accuracy issues in one pKa value",
    "Literature validation: Key literature references for morphine pKa validation:\n1. Avdeef, A. et al. (1998) - reported morphine amine pKa = 8.21\n2.
