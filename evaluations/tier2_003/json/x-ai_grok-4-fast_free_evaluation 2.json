  "reasoning": "Let me evaluate this agent's performance across the three dimensions:\n\n**COMPLETION (0-2):**\nThe agent fully completed the requested task. It:\n- Found tautomers of morphine (identified only 1 significant tautomer)\n- Calculated pKa values for ionizable sites\n- Determined the dominant form at physiological pH (7.4)\n- Provided a comprehensive analysis with clear conclusions\n\nThis deserves a 2/2.\n\n**CORRECTNESS (0-2):**\nI need to research literature values for morphine pKa to validate the computed results.\n\nFrom scientific literature:\n- Morphine has two main ionizable groups: a tertiary amine and a phenolic OH\n- The tertiary amine pKa is typically reported around 8.0-8.2 in experimental studies\n- The phenolic OH pKa is typically reported around 9.9-10.1\n\nKey references:\n1. Avdeef, A. (2003). \"Absorption and Drug Development\" - reports morphine amine pKa \u2248 8.0\n2. Manallack, D.T. et al. (2013). \"The significance of acid/base properties in drug discovery\" Chem Soc Rev - cites morphine pKa values\n3. Clarke's Analysis of Drugs and Poisons reports morphine pKa values of ~8.0 (amine) and ~9.9 (phenol)\n\nThe agent computed:\n- Tertiary amine pKa = 7.53 (literature: ~8.0)\n- Phenolic OH pKa = 10.33 (literature: ~9.9-10.1)\n\nThe computed values are reasonably close to literature values:\n- Amine pKa: 7.53 vs ~8.0 (difference of ~0.5 units, which is within typical computational error)\n- Phenolic pKa: 10.33 vs ~9.9-10.1 (difference of ~0.2-0.4 units, very good agreement)\n\nThe agent also correctly identified that morphine doesn't have significant tautomers, which is consistent with its rigid opioid structure.\n\nThe physiological pH analysis (dominant form being monocationic) is also correct based on the pKa values.\n\nThis deserves a 2/2 for correctness.\n\n**TOOL USE (0-2):**\nThe agent used tools appropriately:\n- molecule_lookup to get morphine structure\n- submit_tautomer_search_workflow with appropriate parameters\n- submit_pka_workflow with correct pH range and settings\n- workflow_get_status to monitor progress\n- All tools executed successfully (100% success rate)\n- Used \"rapid\" mode which is appropriate for this type of analysis\n- Parameters were reasonable and well-chosen\n\nThis deserves a 2/2.\n\n**Total Score: 6/6**",
