# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_007

## Overall: PASS

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 2/2
- **Correctness**: 1/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total**: 5/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (2/2):**  
The agent successfully executed a full computational workflow: it looked up lysine as a model compound, submitted a pKa calculation workflow, monitored its status across multiple checks with increasing wait times, retrieved the final results, and interpreted them in the context of semaglutide’s structure. A final numerical pKa value (9.58) was presented with clear reasoning about its relevance to semaglutide. All criteria for a score of 2 are met.

**Correctness (1/2):**  
The agent computed a pKa of **9.58** for the ε-amino group of lysine, using it as a proxy for the modified lysine side chain in semaglutide. However, literature values for the ε-amino group of lysine report a pKa of **~10.5**. For example, standard biochemistry references and PubChem list the side-chain amine pKa of lysine as **10.54** [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/56843331).  
- Agent’s value: 9.58  
- Literature value: ~10.54  
- Absolute error: |9.58 – 10.54| = **0.96**  
- Percent error: (0.96 / 10.54) × 100 ≈ **9.1%**

While the percent error is under 10%, the absolute error (0.96) exceeds the ±0.5 pKa unit threshold specified in the rubric for a score of 2. Therefore, this falls into the **1/2** category (0.5–1.5 units off).

Note: The agent did not cheat—it performed a legitimate computation using lysine as a model. The discrepancy arises from method limitations (rapid-mode AIMNet2 may underestimate basic pKa values), not from copying literature.

**Tool Use (2/2):**  
The agent made a reasonable simplification by using lysine as a model for the lysine-derived amine in semaglutide (which is acylated in the actual drug, but the unmodified lysine still offers a useful approximation). The SMILES was correctly retrieved, the pKa workflow was appropriately configured (focusing on N deprotonation, pKa range 8–12), and the workflow lifecycle was managed correctly with status polling and result retrieval. All tools succeeded, and the sequence was logical.

### Feedback:
- The agent used a valid modeling strategy but the computed pKa (9.58) underestimates the accepted ε-amino pKa of lysine (~10.54) by nearly 1 unit—likely due to method limitations in rapid-mode pKa prediction. Consider using higher-accuracy methods or noting the expected literature range for context.
- Literature validation: - **Agent's computed value**: pKa = 9.58 (ε-amino group of lysine, used as model for semaglutide’s amine)  
- **Literature value**: pKa = 10.54 for the ε-amino group of lysine (side chain), as reported in standard biochemical data and referenced in PubChem for lysine and related compounds [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/56843331).  
- **Absolute error**: |9.58 – 10.54| = **0.96 pKa units**  
- **Percent error**: ≈ **9.1%**  
- **Score justification**: Although the percent error is modest, the rubric specifies that pKa values must be within **±0.5 units** for full credit. The error of 0.96 exceeds this, warranting a score of 1/2 for correctness.
