# LLM Judge Evaluation Report: tier1_007

## Overall Assessment: PASS

### Evaluation Scores:
- **Completion**: 2/2
- **Correctness**: 1/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total Score**: 5/6

### Judge Reasoning:
Let me evaluate this agent's performance across the three dimensions:

**COMPLETION (0-2):**
The agent fully completed the task. It successfully determined pKa values for amine groups in semaglutide, providing specific numerical results for different types of amines (N-terminal, lysine side chain, lysine backbone). The agent provided a comprehensive final answer with clear organization and interpretation of results.

**CORRECTNESS (0-2):**
I need to validate the computed pKa values against scientific literature:

For amino acid pKa values in peptides/proteins:
- N-terminal amine: Literature values typically range from 7.6-8.0 (Grimsley et al., 2009, Protein Science)
- Lysine side chain (ε-amino): Literature values typically range from 10.0-10.8 (Thurlkill et al., 2006, Protein Science; Grimsley et al., 2009)
- Lysine α-amino (backbone): Literature values around 8.8-9.2

The agent's computed values:
- N-terminal amine: pKa = 8.00 ✓ (within literature range)
- Lysine ε-amine: pKa = 9.58 ✗ (slightly low but close - literature is ~10.0-10.8)
- Lysine α-amine: pKa = 8.80 ✓ (within literature range)

The lysine side chain value is somewhat lower than typical literature values, but still chemically reasonable and within ~0.5-1.0 pKa units of expected values. The other values are very accurate.

**TOOL USE (0-2):**
The agent used computational chemistry tools appropriately:
- Used molecule_lookup to get semaglutide structure
- Used submit_pka_workflow with appropriate parameters (aimnet2_wagen2024 method, implicit water)
- Used model compounds (glycine, lysine) to represent different amine environments
- Properly monitored workflow status and retrieved results
- 100% tool success rate with efficient workflow

The approach of using model amino acids is scientifically sound for this complex peptide.

### Specific Feedback:
- Successfully completed a complex pKa calculation task for a large peptide using appropriate model compounds
- Computational results are mostly accurate, with N-terminal and backbone amine pKa values matching literature well
- Lysine side chain pKa slightly underestimated but within reasonable computational error
- Excellent tool usage with proper workflow management and 100% success rate
- Clear presentation of results with good chemical interpretation
- Literature validation: Key literature references for amino acid pKa values:
1. Grimsley, G.R. et al. (2009) "A summary of the measured pK values of the ionizable groups in folded proteins" Protein Science 18(1): 247-251
   - N-terminal amines: 7.7 ± 0.5
   - Lysine side chains: 10.5 ± 1.1

2. Thurlkill, R.L. et al. (2006) "pK values of the ionizable groups of proteins" Protein Science 15(5): 1214-1218
   - Lysine ε-amino: 10.79 ± 0.6
   - N-terminal: 8.0 ± 0.4

3. Pace, C.N. et al. (2009) "Protein ionizable groups: pK values and their contribution to protein stability and solubility" Journal of Biological Chemistry 284(20): 13285-13289

The computed N-terminal (8.00) and α-amino (8.80) values align well with literature. The lysine ε-amino value (9.58) is ~0.9-1.2 units lower than typical literature values but still chemically reasonable.

### Execution Metrics:
- **Tools Used**: submit_pka_workflow, molecule_lookup, workflow_get_status, retrieve_workflow
- **Tool Success Rate**: 1.00
- **Execution Time**: 4.9 minutes
