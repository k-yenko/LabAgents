Here are the results:\n\n### Calculated Potentials (vs SHE):\n- **Oxidation Potential**: +2.67 V\n- **Reduction Potential**: -3.61 V\n\n### Converted to SCE Reference:\nThe computational results are calculated versus the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE). To convert to the Saturated Calomel Electrode (SCE) reference commonly used in electrochemical experiments:\n\n**Conversion factor**: E<sub>SCE</sub> = E<sub>SHE</sub> - 0.241 V\n\n- **Oxidation Potential vs SCE**: +2.43 V\n- **Reduction Potential vs SCE**: -3.85 V\n\n### Methodology:\nThe calculations were performed using:\n- **Method**: R2SCAN-3c with CPCM solvation model\n- **Solvent**: Acetonitrile  \n- **Reference**: Standard Hydrogen Electrode (converted to SCE)\n- **Workflow**: Redox potential calculation including both oxidation and reduction processes\n\n### Interpretation:\n- The **oxidation potential** of +2.43 V vs SCE indicates that benzene is relatively difficult to oxidize, requiring significant positive potential to remove an electron.\n- The **reduction potential** of -3.85 V vs SCE indicates that benzene is also relatively difficult to reduce, requiring significant negative potential to add an electron.\n- These values are consistent with benzene's aromatic stability and known electrochemical behavior.\n\nThe calculations used Rowan computational chemistry workflows with rigorous quantum mechanical methods accounting for solvation effects in acetonitrile.", "tools_called": ["submit_redox_potential_workflow", "workflow_wait_for_result", "workflow_get_status", "workflow_fetch_latest"], "correctness": null, "notes": ""}
