### 5. Benzene Redox Potential [tier2_006]

**Question**: Calculate the oxidation and reduction potentials of benzene versus SCE in acetonitrile

**Expected**: The oxidation potential versus SCE in acetonitrile is +2.48 ± 0.03 V (electron-transfer equilibria method) and the reduction potential versus SCE in acetonitrile is -3.42 ± 0.05 V (cyclic voltammetry at -60°C).
