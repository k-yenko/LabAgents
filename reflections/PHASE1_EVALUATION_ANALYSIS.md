### **Plot B: Weighted Aggregate Leaderboard**
`plot_b_leaderboard.png`

**Shows**: Definitive ranking using tier-weighted formula: `(tier1_avg√ó1 + tier3_avg√ó4) / total_weight`

**Rankings**:
1. **Claude Opus 4.1**: 5.75/6.0 ‚≠ê
2. **Claude Sonnet 4**: 5.58/6.0 ‚≠ê
3. **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: 4.50/6.0
4. **GPT-5**: 3.08/6.0
5. **Grok Code Fast**: 3.08/6.0

**Key Insight**: There's a clear performance tier gap - Anthropic models are in a league of their own, with a 1+ point gap to the next best model.

### **Plot C: Tier Mastery Stacked Bar Chart**
`plot_c_tier_mastery.png`

**Shows**: How much each model's score comes from basic (Tier 1) vs advanced (Tier 3) tasks

**Key Findings**:
- **Claude Opus**: Dominates both tiers, especially advanced (dark blue sections)
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Strong on basics, weaker on advanced tasks
- **OpenAI models**: Struggling with advanced computational chemistry
- **Budget models**: Minimal contribution from either tier

**Key Insight**: Advanced computational chemistry (Tier 3) is where model quality really differentiates - only Anthropic models excel here.

### **Plot E: Tool Use vs Scientific Accuracy**
`plot_e_tool_vs_accuracy.png`

**Shows**: Critical insight into the "good tools vs good science" trade-off
- **X-axis**: Tool orchestration ability (0-2)
- **Y-axis**: Scientific correctness (0-2)
- **Size**: Tier weight (bigger dots = advanced questions)
- **Color**: Model family

**Quadrant Analysis**:
- **Upper Right (Good Tools + Good Science)**: Anthropic models dominate
- **Upper Left (Poor Tools + Good Science)**: Very few points - rare combination
- **Lower Right (Good Tools + Poor Science)**: Some OpenAI and X.AI instances
- **Lower Left (Poor Tools + Poor Science)**: Budget model cluster

**Key Insight**: Most models can either orchestrate tools OR provide scientific accuracy, but not both. Only Anthropic models consistently achieve both.

### **Plot F: Performance vs Speed Trade-off**
`plot_f_performance_vs_speed.png`

**Shows**: The speed vs quality trade-off for practical deployment

**Key Findings**:
- **Claude Opus**: Highest performance, moderate speed (~3 minutes avg)
- **Claude Sonnet**: High performance, good speed (~2 minutes avg) - **Best Balance**
- **O3**: Fastest (~0.7 minutes) but terrible performance
- **Gemini**: Moderate performance and speed
- **Budget models**: Fast but poor performance

**Key Insight**: Claude Sonnet 4 offers the best performance-to-speed ratio for production use.

### **Plot G: Performance Distribution (4-panel)**
`plot_g_performance_distribution.png`

**Panel 1 - Score by Model**: Box plots showing consistency
- **Anthropic models**: High median, low variance (reliable)
- **Others**: Lower medians, high variance (unpredictable)

**Panel 2 - Score by Tier**: Performance degradation with complexity
- **Tier 1**: Average 2.7/6.0 (moderate difficulty)
- **Tier 3**: Average 4.2/6.0 (actually higher - advanced questions better designed?)

**Panel 3 - Score by Dimension**: Dimension-specific challenges
- **Tool Use**: Highest scores (most models can orchestrate)
- **Correctness**: Most challenging (scientific accuracy hard)
- **Completion**: Moderate (task finishing achievable)

**Panel 4 - Pass Rate by Model**: Binary success metric
- **Anthropic**: 100% pass rates
- **Gemini**: ~89% pass rate
- **Others**: <50% pass rates

**Key Insight**: Computational chemistry requires both reliability AND accuracy - only Anthropic models deliver both consistently.

**For Different Use Cases**:

1. **Research/Publication Quality**: Claude Opus 4.1
   - Unmatched scientific accuracy (1.75/2.0)
   - Perfect reliability (100% pass rate)
   - Worth the cost for critical work

2. **Production/Routine Work**: Claude Sonnet 4
   - Excellent performance (5.58/6.0)
   - Better speed (2 min avg vs 3 min)
   - Cost-effective alternative to Opus

3. **Budget-Conscious**: Google Gemini 2.5 Pro
   - Decent performance (4.50/6.0)
   - 89% pass rate (acceptable reliability)
   - Significant cost savings vs Anthropic

4. **Speed-Critical**: None recommended
   - Fastest models (O3, Deepseek) have <30% reliability
   - Unacceptable for scientific applications

### **üö® Critical Findings**

1. **Tool Orchestration ‚â† Scientific Accuracy**: Many models can call tools but provide wrong chemistry
2. **Tier 3 Tasks Separate the Winners**: Advanced computational chemistry reveals true model capabilities
3. **Reliability is Binary**: Models either work consistently (100%) or fail frequently (<50%)
4. **No Budget Champion**: Significant performance cliff after top 3 models

### **üîÆ Deployment Recommendations**

**Immediate Action**:
- **Switch to Claude Sonnet 4** for all routine computational chemistry
- **Reserve Claude Opus 4.1** for research-grade calculations
- **Avoid OpenAI/X.AI models** for scientific applications until performance improves

**Cost-Benefit Analysis**:
- **Anthropic premium is justified** by 2x higher reliability
- **Failed computational chemistry tasks** cost more than model premium
- **Scientific accuracy cannot be compromised** for cost savings
