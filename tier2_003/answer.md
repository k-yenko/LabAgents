### 2. Caffeine Multi-Property Analysis [tier2_003]

**Question**: Calculate molecular descriptors for caffeine, predict its solubility in water at 25°C, and determine its dipole moment

**Expected**: Molecular descriptors include molecular weight 194.19 g/mol, TPSA 58.44 Å², 0 rotatable bonds, 0 H-bond donors, and 6 H-bond acceptors. Water solubility at 25°C is 2.2 mg/mL (standard experimental value). The dipole moment is 3.70 ± 0.05 D experimentally in benzene and 3.90 D via B3LYP/6-311++G** vacuum calculation.
