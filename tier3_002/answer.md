### 2. Acetaminophen Metabolic Sites [tier3_002]

**Question**: Optimize acetaminophen structure, calculate Fukui indices to identify reactive sites, predict sites of glucuronidation and sulfation, then calculate the ADMET properties

**Expected**: Acetaminophen undergoes glucuronidation (50-70% via UGT1A1, UGT1A6 at phenolic hydroxyl), sulfation (25-35% via SULT1A1, SULT1A3 at phenolic hydroxyl), and oxidation (5-15% via CYP2E1 forming hepatotoxic NAPQI). Fukui indices calculate f(+) for nucleophilic attack, f(-) for electrophilic attack, and f(0) for radical reactions. ADMET properties predict good oral bioavailability, positive blood-brain barrier permeability models, and primarily renal elimination of conjugates.
