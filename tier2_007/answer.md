### 6. Caffeine Temperature Solubility [tier2_007]

**Question**: Predict the solubility of caffeine in water at 25°C, 37°C, and 50°C to determine the temperature dependence

**Expected**: Caffeine solubility in water shows strong temperature dependence: 2.2 mg/mL at 25°C, ~4-5 mg/mL at 37°C (estimated), ~15-20 mg/mL at 50°C (extrapolated), 180 mg/mL at 80°C, and 670 mg/mL at 100°C.
