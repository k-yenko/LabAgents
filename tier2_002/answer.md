### 1. Ibuprofen Conformational Analysis [tier2_002]

**Expected**: DFT B3LYP analysis identifies 8 energy minima conformers with the lowest energy conformer showing s-cis orientation of the carboxylic group (s-trans significantly less stable), matching the single conformer observed in crystal structure. Experimental logP values are 2.48 (OECD guideline 107 shake flask method) and 3.97 (n-octanol/water technique). The pKa of the carboxylic acid group is 4.91 experimentally and 5.8 via DFT prediction in water.
