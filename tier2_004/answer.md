### 3. Morphine Tautomer Analysis [tier2_004]

**Question**: Find all tautomers of morphine and calculate the pKa of each tautomeric form to determine which is dominant at physiological pH

**Expected**: Morphine exists primarily in a single tautomeric form due to its rigid pentacyclic structure. The pKa values are 8.0 for the tertiary amine (computational M06-2X) and 9.9 for the phenolic OH (experimental). At physiological pH 7.4, the dominant form is the monocationic species with protonated tertiary amine (~80% protonated) and neutral phenolic OH.
