      "notes": "While the computational workflow is well-executed, the binding energies (-4.2 to -5.0 kcal/mol) are significantly weaker than expected literature values. Expected Ki values of 2-250 nM correspond to binding energies of approximately -11 to -13 kcal/mol, but the reported values suggest much weaker binding (micromolar range). The response lacks comparison to crystal structure conformation and doesn't address key expected findings like strain energy correlation, buried surface area (1060 \u00c5\u00b2), or the 10,000\u00d7 higher affinity than natural substrate."

      "notes": "While the response demonstrates proper computational workflow setup and conformer generation (13 conformers with 8.16 kcal/mol energy spread), it fails to deliver the key required results. No binding energies were calculated due to incomplete docking, no Ki values reported (expected 2-250 nM range), no binding enthalpy data (expected 0 to -9.3 kcal/mol), and no meaningful comparison to crystal structure conformation. The response acknowledges technical limitations but doesn't provide the essential binding affinity and thermodynamic data that constitutes the core of the question."

      "notes": "Response fails to complete the core task due to technical limitations. While conformer generation was successful (5 conformers with energies around -1865 kcal/mol), docking could not be performed due to pocket format requirements. No binding energies, Ki values, or comparison to crystal structure were provided. The expected Ki range (2-250 nM), binding enthalpy (0 to -9.3 kcal/mol), and structural analysis (buried surface area 1060 \u00c5\u00b2) are completely missing. Response shows process transparency but lacks the essential scientific results."

No conformer generation results, docking data, binding energies (expected Ki 2-250 nM range, binding enthalpy 0 to -9.3 kcal/mol), or crystal structure comparison provided. While the technical explanation is reasonable, the response lacks all substantive scientific content required for evaluation."

While the technical limitation mentioned (binding pocket identification) is understandable, the response provides no numerical results, binding energies, or structural analysis that could be compared to the expected Ki values (2-250 nM), binding enthalpy (0 to -9.3 kcal/mol), or structural insights about the binding interactions."
