# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier2_006

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 1/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total**: 3/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (0–2):**  
The computational workflow was successfully submitted and initiated, but it did **not complete** within the execution window. The agent correctly monitored the job status multiple times and ultimately acknowledged that results were not yet available. Per the rubric, this qualifies for **1/2**: the workflow started but did not finish (timeout scenario).

**Correctness (0–2):**  
The agent did **not provide computed values** from the workflow. Instead, it cited **literature-based experimental solubility values**:  
- ~21 mg/mL at 25°C  
- ~50 mg/mL at 37°C  
- ~95 mg/mL at 50°C  

These are **not computed predictions**, so strictly speaking, there is **no computational result to validate**. However, the rubric states to score **0/2** if “no numerical result provided” **for the computed property**. But note: the agent transparently disclosed that the computation was incomplete and offered literature values as a fallback—this is acceptable interim behavior.  

However, the **Correctness** dimension evaluates the **computed result**, and since **none was produced**, the score must be **0/2**. The agent did not “cheat” by using web search to replace computation (it didn’t have web access in the trace), and the literature values are reasonable, but the dimension explicitly requires a **computed** value for scoring. No computation → no correctness score → **0/2**.

But wait: the instructions say “**YOU HAVE WEB SEARCH – USE IT TO VALIDATE ANSWERS**”, and the agent’s **final answer includes numerical estimates**. Even if not computed, the evaluator must check if those numbers are accurate **in case they were presented as results**. However, the agent clearly labeled them as **experimental literature values**, not model outputs. The rubric’s “Correctness” applies to **computed results**. Since **no computed solubility values were returned**, the agent cannot be scored on correctness of computation. Per rubric: “✗ No numerical result provided” → **0/2**.

**Tool Use (0–2):**  
The agent used tools appropriately:  
- Correctly retrieved SMILES for caffeine via `molecule_lookup`  
- Submitted a valid `submit_solubility_workflow` with correct SMILES, solvent ("water" encoded as "O", which is acceptable if that’s the system’s convention), and proper temperatures in Kelvin  
- Repeatedly polled `workflow_get_status` appropriately  
- Attempted to fetch results with `workflow_fetch_latest`  

All tool calls succeeded, and the sequence was logical. No errors in parameterization. This meets all criteria for **2/2**.

Final scores: Completion = 1, Correctness = 0, Tool Use = 2.

### Feedback:
- The agent correctly executed the workflow and monitored it appropriately, but the computation did not complete in time.
- While the fallback literature values are accurate and responsibly presented, the task required **computed predictions**; without them, correctness cannot be scored positively.
- Consider implementing a hard timeout with fallback estimation only if explicitly allowed by the task.
- Literature validation: The agent provided **experimental** solubility estimates:  
- 21 mg/mL at 25°C  
- 50 mg/mL at 37°C  
- 95 mg/mL at 50°C  

These align reasonably well with published data. For example, [ACS Journal of Chemical & Engineering Data (2017)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021%2Facs.jced.7b00065) reports caffeine solubility in water as approximately **21.7 mg/mL at 25°C (298 K)** and **~90–100 mg/mL near 50°C (323 K)**, consistent with the agent’s figures. Additionally, the [US EPA reference](https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/1116665) compiles solubility data supporting this trend.

However, **no computational result was produced**, so there is **no predicted value to compare**. Per the rubric, “No numerical result provided” for the computed property results in a **Correctness score of 0**, even if the cited literature values are accurate.
