# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_005

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 1/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total**: 3/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (0–2):**  
The agent initiated a redox potential workflow successfully and received a job UUID, indicating the workflow was submitted. However, the final answer states only: "I'll check the status in 10 seconds." There is no evidence in the trace that the agent ever retrieved the actual computed reduction potential value or interpreted it. The workflow status remains "not started" (`"started_at":null,"completed_at":null`), and no result is presented. Therefore, the workflow did **not complete**, and no numerical result was delivered. This meets the criteria for **Score 1/2**: workflow started but didn’t complete.

**Correctness (0–2):**  
No numerical value for the reduction potential was ever provided by the agent. Without a computed result, it is impossible to compare against literature. The rubric explicitly assigns **0/2** when “no numerical result provided.” Even though web search results include PubChem entries for ascorbic acid ([pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/54670067](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/54670067)), they do not list reduction potentials directly. However, literature reports the standard reduction potential for the ascorbate/dehydroascorbate couple as approximately **+0.08 V vs. SHE** at pH 7 (or ~+0.39 V at pH 0). But since the agent never produced a value, correctness cannot be assessed favorably. Hence, **Score 0/2**.

**Tool Use (0–2):**  
The agent correctly used `molecule_lookup` to obtain a SMILES string for ascorbic acid (`OCC(O)C1OC(=C(O)C1=O)O`), which is a valid representation of L-ascorbic acid. It then appropriately called `submit_redox_potential_workflow` with correct parameters, including `reduction=True`. Both tools executed successfully. The sequence (lookup → submit) is logical. The only shortcoming is that the agent did not follow up to retrieve the result—but this may be due to task time limits, not incorrect tool use. The tools were used correctly, so **Score 2/2**.

### Feedback:
- The agent correctly initiated the redox workflow but failed to retrieve or report the actual reduction potential value, rendering the task incomplete and unverifiable. Always ensure final numerical results are obtained and interpreted.
- Literature validation: - **Agent's computed value**: Not provided.  
- **Literature value**: The standard reduction potential for ascorbic acid (ascorbate ⇌ dehydroascorbate + 2H⁺ + 2e⁻) is approximately **+0.056 V to +0.08 V vs. SHE at pH 7**. At standard conditions (pH 0), it is around **+0.39 V**. Source: Bard & Faulkner, *Electrochemical Methods*, and corroborated by biochemical literature (e.g., *Free Radical Biology and Medicine*, 1990). PubChem ([pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/54670067](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/54670067)) confirms the identity of ascorbic acid but does not list electrochemical data directly.  
- **Absolute error**: Undefined (no agent value).  
- **Percent error**: Undefined.  
- **Score justification**: Correctness scored 0 because no numerical result was ever produced, violating a core requirement of the task. Per rubric: “No numerical result provided → 0/2”.
