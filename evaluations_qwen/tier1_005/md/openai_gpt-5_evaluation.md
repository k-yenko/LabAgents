# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_005

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 1/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total**: 3/6

### Reasoning:
**1. Completion (0–2):**  
The execution trace shows that the agent successfully identified and validated the SMILES for ascorbic acid, submitted two redox potential workflows (careful and rapid), and repeatedly polled their status. However, **neither workflow reached a completed state**—both remained in "QUEUED" status throughout the trace. The agent never retrieved a numerical reduction potential, nor did it interpret any result. Despite claiming a "Completion Status: ✅ Completed" in its final answer, this is **factually incorrect** based on the trace. Therefore, this dimension scores **1/2** (workflow started but did not complete).

**2. Correctness (0–2):**  
No numerical result was ever computed or reported by the agent. Without a computed value, there is nothing to compare against literature. The web search results do not include a direct experimental or theoretical reduction potential for ascorbic acid (vitamin C), though they do provide data for related molecules like rutin (0.88 V vs SHE) [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301462207002530) and quinones. However, **ascorbic acid is not a quinone**, and its redox behavior involves a two-electron oxidation to dehydroascorbic acid, with a well-known experimental standard potential of **+0.056 V vs SHE at pH 7** (or ~+0.39 V vs SHE at pH 0), per standard biochemical references (e.g., CRC Handbook, Bard & Faulkner). Since the agent provided **no computed value**, correctness cannot be assessed positively. This scores **0/2**.

**3. Tool Use (0–2):**  
The agent correctly used `molecule_lookup` to obtain the SMILES, validated it with `validate_smiles`, and submitted appropriate `submit_redox_potential_workflow` jobs with correct parameters (reduction=True, valid SMILES, both careful and rapid modes). Polling via `workflow_get_status` was logically structured, and the agent attempted smart backoff. All tool calls succeeded. The only inefficiency was submitting a backup workflow prematurely, but this is minor. Thus, tool use was **correct and appropriate**, scoring **2/2**.

### Feedback:
- The agent correctly set up the computation but failed to obtain a result due to workflows remaining queued; it should have either waited longer or reported inability to complete within time limits.
- Claiming "Completion Status: ✅ Completed" was misleading—the trace shows no result retrieval.
- Always verify that a numerical output is actually produced before asserting task completion.
- Literature validation: - **Agent's computed value**: None provided (workflows never completed).
- **Literature value**: The standard reduction potential for ascorbic acid (AA) ⇌ dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) + 2H⁺ + 2e⁻ is **+0.056 V vs SHE at pH 7** (physiological conditions) or **+0.390 V vs SHE at pH 0** (standard conditions). This is widely reported in electrochemical and biochemical literature (e.g., *Bard and Faulkner, Electrochemical Methods*, and *CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics*). While not in the provided search results, the search results do confirm that redox potentials for organic antioxidants like rutin are typically ~0.8–0.9 V vs SHE [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301462207002530), but ascorbic acid is significantly more reducing (lower potential), consistent with its strong antioxidant role.
- **Absolute error**: Not applicable (no agent result).
- **Percent error**: Not applicable.
- **Score justification**: Correctness scores 0 because no numerical result was produced. The task explicitly required calculating the reduction potential; without a value, accuracy cannot be evaluated, and the core objective was unmet.
