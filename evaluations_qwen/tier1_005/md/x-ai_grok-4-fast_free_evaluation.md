# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_005

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 1/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total**: 3/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (0–2):**  
The agent initiated a redox potential workflow correctly by first retrieving the SMILES for ascorbic acid and then submitting a redox potential job with appropriate parameters (`reduction=True`, `oxidization=True`, `mode='careful'`). However, the execution trace ends with the agent stating, “I'll check status in 10 seconds,” and no further steps are taken to retrieve or report the actual computed redox potential. The workflow was submitted but never completed or finalized in the trace—no numerical result is presented, and no interpretation is given. Therefore, the workflow did **not finish** from the user’s perspective. This matches the 1/2 criterion: workflow started but didn’t complete.

**Correctness (0–2):**  
No numerical result was provided by the agent, so there is nothing to validate against literature. According to the rubric, this automatically earns a **0/2** for correctness. Even though web search results confirm that ascorbic acid (L-ascorbic acid) is a well-known antioxidant with a standard reduction potential around +0.06 to +0.08 V vs. SHE (Standard Hydrogen Electrode) for the ascorbate/dehydroascorbate couple [not explicitly in provided sources but widely documented in electrochemistry literature], the agent never produced a value to compare. The provided search results from PubChem and ChEBI describe ascorbic acid’s roles and structure but do not list experimental redox potentials. Since the agent didn’t output a number, correctness cannot be assessed favorably.

**Tool Use (0–2):**  
The agent used `molecule_lookup` correctly to obtain a valid SMILES string for ascorbic acid (`OCC(O)C1OC(=C(O)C1=O)O`), which corresponds to L-ascorbic acid. Then it appropriately called `submit_redox_potential_workflow` with valid parameters, including both oxidation and reduction, and a descriptive name. Both tools executed successfully (✓ Success). The only flaw is that the agent did not follow through to retrieve the result (e.g., by calling a status-check or result-fetching tool after waiting). However, the rubric for Tool Use focuses on selection, parameters, and execution—not necessarily full end-to-end completion (which is covered under Completion). Since all used tools were appropriate, parameters were valid, and executions succeeded, this merits a **2/2**.

### Feedback:
- The agent correctly initiated the redox workflow but failed to retrieve or report the result, leaving the task incomplete. Always ensure the final numerical output is obtained and interpreted.
- Literature validation: - Agent's computed value: **Not provided**  
- Literature value: The standard reduction potential for the ascorbic acid/dehydroascorbic acid couple is approximately **+0.06 V to +0.08 V vs. SHE** at physiological pH, though exact values depend on conditions (pH, ionic strength). While this specific value isn't listed in the provided search results, authoritative sources like Bard & Faulkner’s *Electrochemical Methods* or the CRC Handbook report this range. The PubChem entries confirm the identity of L-ascorbic acid as the biologically active enantiomer and note its role as an antioxidant and cofactor [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/54670067](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/54670067), [ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:29073](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI%3A29073).  
- Absolute error: **Undefined (no agent value)**  
- Percent error: **Undefined**  
- Score justification: **0/2** because no numerical result was provided, making validation impossible per rubric instructions.
