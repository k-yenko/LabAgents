  "reasoning": "**Completion (0\u20132):**  \nThe agent initiated a redox potential workflow successfully and received a job UUID, indicating the workflow was submitted. However, the final answer states only: \"I'll check the status in 10 seconds.\" There is no evidence in the trace that the agent ever retrieved the actual computed reduction potential value or interpreted it. The workflow status remains \"not started\" (`\"started_at\":null,\"completed_at\":null`), and no result is presented. Therefore, the workflow did **not complete**, and no numerical result was delivered. This meets the criteria for **Score 1/2**: workflow started but didn\u2019t complete.\n\n**Correctness (0\u20132):**  \nNo numerical value for the reduction potential was ever provided by the agent. Without a computed result, it is impossible to compare against literature. The rubric explicitly assigns **0/2** when \u201cno numerical result provided.\u201d Even though web search results include PubChem entries for ascorbic acid ([pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/54670067](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/54670067)), they do not list reduction potentials directly. However, literature reports the standard reduction potential for the ascorbate/dehydroascorbate couple as approximately **+0.08 V vs. SHE** at pH 7 (or ~+0.39 V at pH 0). But since the agent never produced a value, correctness cannot be assessed favorably. Hence, **Score 0/2**.\n\n**Tool Use (0\u20132):**  \nThe agent correctly used `molecule_lookup` to obtain a SMILES string for ascorbic acid (`OCC(O)C1OC(=C(O)C1=O)O`), which is a valid representation of L-ascorbic acid. It then appropriately called `submit_redox_potential_workflow` with correct parameters, including `reduction=True`. Both tools executed successfully. The sequence (lookup \u2192 submit) is logical. The only shortcoming is that the agent did not follow up to retrieve the result\u2014but this may be due to task time limits, not incorrect tool use. The tools were used correctly, so **Score 2/2**.",

    "Literature validation: - **Agent's computed value**: Not provided.  \n- **Literature value**: The standard reduction potential for ascorbic acid (ascorbate \u21cc dehydroascorbate + 2H\u207a + 2e\u207b) is approximately **+0.056 V to +0.08 V vs. SHE at pH 7**. At standard conditions (pH 0), it is around **+0.39 V**. Source: Bard & Faulkner, *Electrochemical Methods*, and corroborated by biochemical literature (e.g., *Free Radical Biology and Medicine*, 1990). PubChem ([pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/54670067](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/54670067)) confirms the identity of ascorbic acid but does not list electrochemical data directly.  \n- **Absolute error**: Undefined (no agent value).  \n- **Percent error**: Undefined.  \n- **Score justification**: Correctness scored 0 because no numerical result was ever produced, violating a core requirement of the task. Per rubric: \u201cNo numerical result provided \u2192 0/2\u201d."
