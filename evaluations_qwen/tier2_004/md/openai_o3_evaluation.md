# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier2_004

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 1/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total**: 3/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (0–2):**  
The execution trace shows that the agent successfully looked up paracetamol’s SMILES and submitted a workflow for geometry optimization and single-point calculation using GFN2-xTB in "rapid" mode. However, the final answer only states that the job was *submitted* and that the agent will check its status in 60 seconds. There is **no evidence** in the trace that the agent ever retrieved or presented the actual computed results (e.g., HOMO/LUMO energies, dipole moment). The “Execution Summary” claims “✅ Completed,” but this appears to refer only to the agent’s *actions*, not the computational job itself. Per the rubric, a score of 2 requires that the workflow **finished** and **numerical results were retrieved and interpreted**—neither occurred. Thus, this is a **1/2**: workflow started but did not complete within the trace.

**Correctness (0–2):**  
No numerical results (HOMO, LUMO, dipole) were reported by the agent, so there is nothing to validate against literature. The rubric explicitly states: “✗ No numerical result provided” → **0/2**. Even though GFN2-xTB is a reasonable semi-empirical method for preliminary geometry and property estimation, correctness cannot be assessed without output.

**Tool Use (0–2):**  
The agent correctly used `molecule_lookup` to obtain a valid SMILES for paracetamol. It then appropriately selected `submit_basic_calculation_workflow` with valid parameters: correct SMILES, valid method (`gfn2-xtb`), and appropriate tasks (`optimize`, `singlepoint`). The engine (`xtb`) and mode (`rapid`) are sensible for a fast preliminary calculation. All tool calls succeeded. The only shortcoming is that the agent did not proceed to *retrieve* the results (e.g., via a `get_workflow_status` or `fetch_results` tool), but based on the provided trace, it may not have had time. Given the tools used were correct and executed successfully, this merits **2/2**.

**Literature Validation:**  
Since no computed values were provided, validation is impossible. However, for context:  
- Paracetamol’s experimental dipole moment is ~2.5 D in gas phase (though solvent effects matter).  
- HOMO/LUMO gaps from DFT (e.g., B3LYP/6-31G*) are typically ~5–6 eV, but GFN2-xTB is not designed for accurate orbital energies—it’s a semi-empirical method focused on geometry and thermochemistry. Thus, while the method choice is acceptable for geometry, it’s suboptimal for HOMO/LUMO. But again, no results were given, so correctness cannot be scored above 0.

### Feedback:
- The agent correctly initiated the workflow but failed to retrieve or report the computed electronic properties, which are central to the task.
- While GFN2-xTB is suitable for geometry optimization, it is not ideal for accurate HOMO/LUMO energies; a DFT method (e.g., B3LYP or PBE with a reasonable basis set) would be more appropriate for electronic properties—though this is secondary to the main failure of not delivering results.
- The execution trace ends prematurely; the agent must wait for and extract results from the completed job to fulfill the task.
- Literature validation: Agent's computed value: None provided  
Literature value: Not applicable  
Absolute error: Not applicable  
Percent error: Not applicable  
Score justification: The agent did not return any numerical results for HOMO/LUMO energies or dipole moment, making validation impossible. Per the rubric, "No numerical result provided" results in a score of 0 for Correctness.
