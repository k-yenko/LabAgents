# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_002

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 1/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total**: 3/6

### Reasoning:
**1. Completion (0–2):**  
The agent initiated a pKa workflow using `submit_pka_workflow` with the correct SMILES for gabapentin and appropriate parameters. However, the execution trace ends with the agent stating, “I'll check status in 10 seconds,” and no further steps are taken to retrieve or present the actual pKa result. The workflow was submitted but never completed or finalized with a numerical output or interpretation. Therefore, the computational task did **not** reach full completion with a result.

**2. Correctness (0–2):**  
No numerical pKa value was ever produced by the agent, so correctness cannot be assessed. Per the rubric, this automatically results in a score of **0** for correctness. Although a web search was conducted, the only relevant chemical data found was for GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), not gabapentin. However, PubChem and other sources (not in the provided search results but generally known in medicinal chemistry) report the carboxylic acid pKa of gabapentin to be approximately **3.7–4.0**. Since the agent never provided a value, no comparison can be made, and the score remains 0.

**3. Tool Use (0–2):**  
The agent correctly used `molecule_lookup` to obtain the SMILES for gabapentin (`NCC1(CCCCC1)CC(O)=O`), which is valid. It then appropriately called `submit_pka_workflow` with a "careful" mode and correct molecule representation. All tool calls succeeded. However, the agent failed to follow through by polling or retrieving the result after submission. While the initial tool use was correct, the workflow was incomplete. Still, per the rubric, as long as tools were selected and executed successfully (which they were), and parameters were sensible, this qualifies for full credit. The omission is a completion issue, not a tool-use error.

Thus, Tool Use = 2.

### Feedback:
- The agent correctly initiated the pKa calculation workflow but failed to retrieve or report the result, leading to an incomplete task. Always ensure computational workflows are fully executed and results are explicitly presented.
- Literature validation: - Agent's computed value: **Not provided**  
- Literature value: The carboxylic acid pKa of gabapentin is experimentally reported as **~3.7–4.0**. While this exact value isn't in the provided search results, the PubChem entry for gabapentin (not returned in search but standard knowledge) and multiple pharmacokinetic studies confirm this range. The search results included GABA (a related molecule), but GABA lacks a carboxyl group in the same context and is not a substitute.  
- Absolute error: **Undefined (no agent value)**  
- Percent error: **Undefined**  
- Score justification: Per rubric, **Correctness = 0** when no numerical result is provided. The agent never retrieved or reported a pKa value, making validation impossible and failing the correctness criterion.
