# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_002

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 1/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total**: 3/6

### Reasoning:
**1. Completion (0–2):**  
The agent initiated two pKa workflows (one "careful", one "rapid") to compute the microscopic pKa of the carboxyl group in gabapentin with the amine protonated. However, **neither workflow completed**—both were still in "RUNNING" status at the end of the trace, and **no numerical pKa value was ever retrieved or reported**. The final answer explicitly states: “The rapid microscopic pKa workflow is still running... I will keep monitoring... as soon as it finishes.” This indicates the computational task did **not finish**, and no result was produced. Therefore, **Completion = 1/2** (workflow started but didn’t complete).

**2. Correctness (0–2):**  
Because **no computed pKa value was returned**, there is **no numerical result to validate**. The agent provided a reasonable *estimate* (~2–4) based on chemical intuition, but that is not a computed result. The rubric states: “Score 0/2 IF: ✗ No numerical result provided.” Thus, **Correctness = 0/2**.

To support this, I searched for experimental or literature pKa values for gabapentin. PubChem lists gabapentin hydrochloride but does not directly report pKa values in the provided snippet. However, gabapentin is a γ-amino acid analog, and typical α-amino acids have carboxyl pKa values around 2.0–2.4. For gabapentin specifically, literature reports the carboxylic acid pKa as **approximately 3.7–4.0** (though not in the provided search results). Regardless, since the agent **did not output any computed number**, correctness cannot be scored above 0.

**3. Tool Use (0–2):**  
The agent correctly:
- Used `molecule_lookup` to obtain SMILES.
- Constructed the protonated form `[NH3+]CC1(CCCCC1)CC(=O)O` appropriate for stomach pH.
- Submitted a pKa workflow with `deprotonate_elements='O'` to isolate carboxyl deprotonation.
- Used both "careful" and "rapid" modes appropriately when the first was too slow.
- Stopped the long-running job to conserve resources.
- Monitored workflow status repeatedly.

All tool calls succeeded, parameters were valid, and the sequence was logical. Minor inefficiency in polling frequency doesn’t constitute a critical flaw. Thus, **Tool Use = 2/2**.

### Feedback:
- The agent executed a sound plan and used tools correctly but failed to deliver a computed pKa value, which is the core requirement. Without a final numerical result, the task is incomplete and cannot be validated for correctness.
- Literature validation: - **Agent's computed value**: None provided (workflow did not complete).
- **Literature value**: While not explicitly listed in the provided search results, gabapentin’s carboxyl pKa is known from external literature to be approximately **3.7–4.0**. The PubChem entry for gabapentin hydrochloride confirms its structure as a carboxylic acid with a primary amine [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Gabapentin-hydrochloride), consistent with amino acid-like behavior. Typical aliphatic carboxylic acids have pKa ~4.8, but the electron-withdrawing effect of the nearby ammonium group in the protonated form lowers the pKa. For example, in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the carboxyl pKa is ~4.2; gabapentin, with a cyclohexyl group, may have slightly different electronic effects. A study referenced in [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166128010000783) notes that carboxylic acid pKa values in similar contexts range from 4.4–5.0, though that refers to bilirubin. More relevantly, experimental data (outside provided results) places gabapentin’s carboxyl pKa near **3.9**.
- **Absolute error**: Not applicable (no computed value).
- **Percent error**: Not applicable.
- **Score justification**: Correctness scored 0 because **no numerical result was produced**, per rubric instructions.
