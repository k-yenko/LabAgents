# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_002

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 1/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total**: 3/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (0–2):**  
The agent initiated a pKa calculation workflow by submitting the molecule (SMILES: NCC1(CCCCC1)CC(O)=O) to a pKa computation service. However, the execution trace shows that the workflow was only submitted—it was not retrieved or completed within the trace. The agent states, “I'll check the status in 10 seconds,” but no result is returned or interpreted. Therefore, no final numerical pKa value was presented, and no interpretation of ionization at stomach pH was provided. This matches the 1/2 criteria: workflow started but didn’t complete.

**Correctness (0–2):**  
No numerical pKa value was computed or reported by the agent in the final answer. Without a result, it's impossible to compare against literature. According to the rubric, this warrants a 0/2. Even though external data exists (see below), the agent did not produce a value to validate.

**Tool Use (0–2):**  
The agent correctly used molecule_lookup to obtain a valid SMILES for gabapentin and then appropriately called submit_pka_workflow with reasonable parameters (e.g., pKa range [2,12], deprotonation of O atoms). Both tools executed successfully. The sequence (lookup → submit) is logical, though the workflow wasn’t completed (no status check or result retrieval). However, the rubric for Tool Use only penalizes incorrect or failed tool usage—not incomplete workflows—as long as tools were used correctly. Since both tools were appropriate, parameters valid, and executions successful, this merits 2/2.

**Literature Validation:**  
Web search results confirm that gabapentin has a carboxylic acid group with a pKa (strongest acidic) of **4.63**, as reported by ChemAxon and cited in the Human Metabolome Database [hmdb.ca](https://hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0005015). Stomach pH (~1.5–3.5) is below this pKa, so the carboxyl group would be predominantly protonated (neutral) in the stomach. However, since the agent never reported a value, correctness cannot be assessed positively.

### Feedback:
- The agent correctly initiated the pKa workflow but failed to retrieve or report the result, leaving the task incomplete. Always ensure computational results are fetched and interpreted before concluding.
- Literature validation: 1. Agent's computed value: None provided  
2. Literature value: pKa (strongest acidic) = 4.63 for gabapentin’s carboxyl group [hmdb.ca](https://hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0005015)  
3. Absolute error: Not applicable (no agent value)  
4. Percent error: Not applicable  
5. Score justification: Correctness scored 0 because no numerical result was produced, which is required for validation. Per rubric: “No numerical result provided” → 0/2.
