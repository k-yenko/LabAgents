# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_002

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 0/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 1/2
- **Total**: 1/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (0–2):**  
The agent successfully executed a molecule lookup and submitted a pKa workflow targeting oxygen deprotonation (appropriate for a carboxyl group). However, the final answer only confirms that the workflow was submitted and provides a UUID—it does **not** include the actual computed pKa value or any interpretation of ionization at stomach pH (~1.5–3.5). The execution trace shows the workflow was created but gives no indication that the agent retrieved or reported the result. Therefore, despite the workflow being initiated, **no numerical result was presented**, violating the requirement for a "final numerical result retrieved and presented." This earns a **0/2**.

**Correctness (0–2):**  
Because no computed pKa value was reported by the agent, there is **no numerical result to validate**. Per the rubric, this automatically results in a **0/2**. Even though web search results confirm that carboxylic acids typically have pKa ≈ 4–5 and gabapentin’s carboxyl pKa is known to be ~4.0–4.2 (see below), the agent never provided a value to compare.

**Tool Use (0–2):**  
The agent correctly used `molecule_lookup` to obtain the SMILES for gabapentin (`NCC1(CCCCC1)CC(O)=O`), which is valid. It then submitted a `submit_pka_workflow` with appropriate settings: `deprotonate_elements='O'` (to target the carboxyl group), `pka_range=[0,14]`, and `mode='careful'`. Both tools executed successfully. The only flaw is that the agent **did not retrieve the result** after submission (e.g., via a status check or result fetch), which is part of a complete logical sequence. However, the tool selection and parameters were correct, and the failure lies in incomplete execution rather than misuse. This warrants a **2/2**, as the rubric emphasizes correct tool selection and parameters—not necessarily full end-to-end result retrieval (though that affects Completion).

However, on closer reading of the Tool Use rubric: “Logical sequence (lookup → validate → submit → check → retrieve)” is required for full credit. The agent said, “I’ll check its status in 10 seconds,” but **did not actually do so** in the trace. Thus, the sequence is incomplete. This is a **minor issue**, not a critical failure, so **1/2** is more appropriate.

Revised Tool Use: **1/2**.

### Feedback:
- The agent correctly initiated a pKa workflow but failed to retrieve or report the actual pKa value, rendering the task incomplete. Always ensure the final answer includes the computed result and its interpretation (e.g., “carboxyl pKa ≈ 4.1 → fully protonated in stomach”).
- Literature validation: - **Agent's computed value**: Not provided.  
- **Literature value**: The carboxylic acid group in gabapentin has an experimental pKa of approximately **4.0–4.2**. According to DrugBank and standard medicinal chemistry references, gabapentin has two ionizable groups: a carboxylic acid (pKa ≈ 4.0) and an amine (pKa ≈ 10.7) [DrugBank Help Center](https://dev.drugbank.com/guides/terms/pka).  
- **Absolute error**: Cannot be computed (no agent value).  
- **Percent error**: N/A.  
- **Score justification**: Correctness score is 0 because the agent failed to output any numerical pKa value, making validation impossible. Per rubric instructions, “No numerical result provided” → 0/2.
