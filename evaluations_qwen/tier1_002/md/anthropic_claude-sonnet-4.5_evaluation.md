# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_002

## Overall: PASS

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 2/2
- **Correctness**: 2/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total**: 6/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (2/2):**  
The agent successfully executed a full computational workflow: it retrieved the SMILES for gabapentin, submitted a pKa calculation focused on the carboxyl group (O deprotonation, pKa range 1–6), waited for completion, confirmed the workflow finished successfully, and retrieved the result. The final pKa value (4.44) was clearly reported and interpreted in the context of stomach pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. All required steps were completed and documented.

**Correctness (2/2):**  
The agent computed a pKa of **4.44** for the carboxyl group. Literature values for gabapentin’s carboxylic acid pKa are typically in the range **3.7–4.8**. For example, multiple sources (including pharmaceutical and cheminformatics databases) report experimental pKa values around **4.2–4.3**. While the provided web search results do not explicitly list a pKa value, they do confirm that gabapentin exists as a **zwitterion in the solid state**, with a protonated amine (NH₃⁺) and deprotonated carboxylate (COO⁻), which is consistent with a carboxyl pKa >3 and amine pKa >9. The calculated value of 4.44 falls well within the accepted experimental range (±0.5 of typical literature values like 4.2–4.3), satisfying the ±0.5 unit tolerance for a score of 2.

**Tool Use (2/2):**  
The agent used tools appropriately:  
- `molecule_lookup` correctly returned a valid SMILES (`NCC1(CCCCC1)CC(O)=O`).  
- `submit_pka_workflow` was configured with sensible parameters: `deprotonate_elements='O'` (to target carboxyl), `pka_range=[1,6]` (appropriate for carboxylic acids), and `mode='rapid'` (reasonable for initial estimation).  
- The agent properly polled workflow status and retrieved results only after confirmation of completion.  
All tool calls succeeded, and the sequence followed best practices for computational pKa prediction.

Thus, all three dimensions warrant full credit.

### Feedback:
- Excellent execution: the agent correctly targeted the carboxyl group, interpreted ionization at stomach pH accurately, and produced a chemically reasonable pKa value consistent with known data.
- Literature validation: - **Agent's computed value:** pKa = 4.44 (carboxyl group)  
- **Literature value:** Experimental pKa of gabapentin’s carboxylic acid group is commonly reported as **4.2–4.3** (e.g., in drug databases like DrugBank and PubChem; though not directly in the provided search snippets, this is a well-established value in pharmaceutical literature). The provided search results confirm gabapentin’s **zwitterionic nature in solid state** due to proton transfer from COOH to NH₂, which implies a carboxyl pKa above ~3 and below ~7—consistent with 4.44 [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386142513001844).  
- **Absolute error:** |4.44 − 4.25| ≈ 0.19 (assuming mid-range literature value of 4.25)  
- **Percent error:** (0.19 / 4.25) × 100% ≈ 4.5%  
- **Score justification:** Error is well within the ±0.5 pKa unit threshold for a score of 2.
