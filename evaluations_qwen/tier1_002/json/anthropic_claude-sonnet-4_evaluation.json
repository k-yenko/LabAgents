      "content": "Compared to the SAMPL6 p _K_ a challenge, accuracy remains unchanged in SAMPL7. Interestingly, here, though macroscopic p _K_ a values were often predicted with reasonable accuracy, there was dramatically more disagreement among participants as to which microscopic transitions produced these values (with methods often disagreeing even as to the sign of the free energy change associated with certain transitions), indicating far more work needs to be done on p _K_ a prediction methods. ### [LogP prediction performance with the SMD solvation model and the M06 density functional family for SAMPL6 blind prediction challenge molecules](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10822-020-00278-1?fromPaywallRec=false)"

      "content": "Here, we report on a SAMPL7 physical property challenge that focused on octanol-water partition coefficients (log\u00a0 P) and p K a for the series of molecules shown in Fig. 1. The p K a of a molecule, or the negative logarithm of the acid-base dissociation constant, is related to the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of a particular acid into its conjugate base and a free proton. The p K a also corresponds to the pH at which the corresponding acid and its conjugate base each are populated equally in solution. Given that the p K a corresponds to a transition between specific protonation states, a given molecule may have multiple p K a values."

      "title": "Overview of the SAMPL6 pKa Challenge: Evaluating small molecule microscopic and macroscopic pKa predictions",
      "content": "Underestimation of ligand p _K_ a by 1 unit can lead to errors in binding free energy errors up to 1.2 kcal/mol. The SAMPL6 p _K_ a Challenge demonstrated the need for improving p _K_ a prediction methods for drug-like molecules, especially for challenging moieties and multiprotic molecules. The acid dissociation constant ( _K_ a) describes the protonation state equilibrium of a molecule given pH. More commonly, we refer to _pK_ a = \u2212log10 **_K_** _a\u2032_, its negative logarithmic form. Predicting p _K_ a is a prerequisite for predicting many other properties of small molecules such as their protein binding affinity, distribution coefficient (log _D_), membrane permeability, and solubility."

      "content": "Collecting both microscopic and macroscopic p _K_ a predictions allowed in-depth evaluation of p _K_ a prediction performance. This article highlights deficiencies of typical p _K_ a prediction evaluation approaches when the distinction between microscopic and macroscopic p _K_ as is ignored; in particular, we suggest more stringent evaluation criteria for microscopic and macroscopic p _K_ a predictions guided by the available experimental data. Top-performing submissions for macroscopic p _K_ a predictions achieved RMSE of 0.7\u20131.0 p _K_ a units and included both quantum chemical and empirical approaches, where the total number of extra or missing macroscopic p _K_ as predicted by these submissions were fewer than 8 for 24 molecules."

      "content": " Abstract Partition coefficients describe the equilibrium partitioning of a single, defined charge state of a solute between two liquid phases in contact, typically a neutral solute. Octanol\u2013water partition coefficients (\\(K_{\\rm ow}\\)), or their logarithms (log\u00a0 P), are frequently used as a measure of lipophilicity in drug discovery. The partition coefficient is a physicochemical property that captures the thermodynamics of relative solvation between aqueous and nonpolar phases, and therefore provides an excellent test for physics-based computational models that predict properties of pharmaceutical relevance such as protein-ligand binding affinities or hydration/solvation free energies."
