      "content": " Background &amp; Summary Over the last two decades, machine learning (ML) methods have developed to become a standard tool in the field of computational chemistry. They allow to directly predict the properties of chemical structures without the need for solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation explicitly. Compared to ab initio calculations, which typically have high computational costs and scale poorly with system size, ML methods enable orders of magnitude speedup 1, 2, 3, 4. They have been used to construct machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) 5 for materials 6, small molecules 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and more recently, also larger systems with hundreds of atoms 13 or proteins in solution 14."

      "content": "Compared to the SAMPL6 p _K_ a challenge, accuracy remains unchanged in SAMPL7. Interestingly, here, though macroscopic p _K_ a values were often predicted with reasonable accuracy, there was dramatically more disagreement among participants as to which microscopic transitions produced these values (with methods often disagreeing even as to the sign of the free energy change associated with certain transitions), indicating far more work needs to be done on p _K_ a prediction methods. ### [LogP prediction performance with the SMD solvation model and the M06 density functional family for SAMPL6 blind prediction challenge molecules](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10822-020-00278-1?fromPaywallRec=false)"

We compared the experimentally measured macroscopic pKa values to the microscopic pKa values computed by Rowan, considering only the most acidic and basic microscopic sites on each molecule: we compared each one to the closest macroscopic value, [consistent with the matching procedures detailed here](https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL6/tree/master/physical_properties/pKa/analysis/analysis_of_typeIII_predictions_24mol). This had the effect of excluding doubly ionized microstates. Data for SAMPL7 was obtained from [the SAMPL7 Github repository](https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL7/blob/master/physical_property/pKa/analysis/macrostate_analysis/pKa_experimental_values.csv). Since only one pKa value was obtained for each molecule, assignment was straightforward."

      "content": "Collecting both microscopic and macroscopic p _K_ a predictions allowed in-depth evaluation of p _K_ a prediction performance. This article highlights deficiencies of typical p _K_ a prediction evaluation approaches when the distinction between microscopic and macroscopic p _K_ as is ignored; in particular, we suggest more stringent evaluation criteria for microscopic and macroscopic p _K_ a predictions guided by the available experimental data. Top-performing submissions for macroscopic p _K_ a predictions achieved RMSE of 0.7\u20131.0 p _K_ a units and included both quantum chemical and empirical approaches, where the total number of extra or missing macroscopic p _K_ as predicted by these submissions were fewer than 8 for 24 molecules."

      "title": "Overview of the SAMPL6 pKa Challenge: Evaluating small molecule microscopic and macroscopic pKa predictions",
      "content": "Underestimation of ligand p _K_ a by 1 unit can lead to errors in binding free energy errors up to 1.2 kcal/mol. The SAMPL6 p _K_ a Challenge demonstrated the need for improving p _K_ a prediction methods for drug-like molecules, especially for challenging moieties and multiprotic molecules. The acid dissociation constant ( _K_ a) describes the protonation state equilibrium of a molecule given pH. More commonly, we refer to _pK_ a = \u2212log10 **_K_** _a\u2032_, its negative logarithmic form. Predicting p _K_ a is a prerequisite for predicting many other properties of small molecules such as their protein binding affinity, distribution coefficient (log _D_), membrane permeability, and solubility."
