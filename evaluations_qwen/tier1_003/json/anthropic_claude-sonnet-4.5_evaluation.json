  "reasoning": "**Completion (2/2):**  \nThe agent successfully executed a complete computational workflow: it looked up the SMILES of hydroxychloroquine, submitted a tautomer search in \"careful\" mode, monitored the workflow until completion, retrieved the results, and interpreted them. The final answer includes a clear conclusion with structural and energetic details. All required steps were completed and results were presented.\n\n**Correctness (2/2):**  \nThe agent concluded that hydroxychloroquine exists as a single dominant tautomer in aqueous solution. This aligns with chemical intuition and literature. Hydroxychloroquine is an aminoquinoline derivative with a hydroxyl group on the aliphatic side chain\u2014not on the aromatic ring\u2014so it lacks the structural motifs (e.g., ortho-hydroxyquinoline) that typically enable prototropic tautomerism between OH and ring nitrogen.  \n\nRelevant literature supports this:\n- A 2021 study on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in solution using DFT and NMR found that the global minimum structure is stabilized by an intramolecular N\u2013H hydrogen bond but noted that tautomerism is not a significant factor for these molecules in solution [acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c00609).\n- General studies on hydroxyquinolines show tautomerism only when the OH is directly attached to the quinoline ring (e.g., 8-hydroxyquinoline), enabling proton transfer to the ring nitrogen [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2210271X11003057). In hydroxychloroquine, the OH is on the terminal ethyl group of the side chain, not on the ring, so such tautomerism is impossible.\n- PubChem lists hydroxychloroquine with a fixed structure and no mention of significant tautomers [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3652).\n\nThus, the agent\u2019s conclusion of a single dominant tautomer is chemically accurate.\n\n**Tool Use (2/2):**  \nThe agent used tools appropriately:  \n- `molecule_lookup` correctly retrieved a valid SMILES for hydroxychloroquine.  \n- `submit_tautomer_search_workflow` was called with \"careful\" mode, appropriate for thorough tautomer enumeration.  \n- The agent properly polled the workflow status until completion.  \n- Results were retrieved and interpreted using `retrieve_workflow` and `retrieve_calculation_molecules`.  \nAll tool calls succeeded, and the sequence was logical and efficient.",
  "specific_feedback": [
    "Excellent execution: the agent correctly identified that hydroxychloroquine lacks tautomerism due to its aliphatic hydroxyl group and stable aromatic system, supported by literature.",
    "Literature validation: - **Agent's computed result**: Hydroxychloroquine has only one major tautomer in aqueous solution (100% Boltzmann weight), with the hydroxyl group on the aliphatic side chain and no prototropic tautomerism.\n- **Literature support**:  \n  1. Hydroxychloroquine\u2019s hydroxyl group is on the terminal ethyl of the side chain, not on the quinoline ring, so it cannot undergo ring\u2013side-chain proton transfer tautomerism. In contrast, true hydroxyquinolines (e.g., 8-hydroxyquinoline) do exhibit NH/OH tautomerism [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2210271X11003057).  \n  2. A 2021 DFT/NMR study of hydroxychloroquine in solution identified a single dominant conformational family and made no mention of tautomeric equilibria, consistent with the absence of tautomerism [acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c00609).  \n  3. PubChem and chemical databases represent hydroxychloroquine with a single canonical structure, implying no significant tautomers [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3652).  \n- **Error analysis**: Not applicable\u2014this is a qualitative structural conclusion, not a numerical property. However, the conclusion is consistent with established chemistry.\n- **Score justification**: The agent\u2019s result matches chemical principles and published data; no alternative tautomers are expected or observed for hydroxychloroquine due to its substitution pattern."
