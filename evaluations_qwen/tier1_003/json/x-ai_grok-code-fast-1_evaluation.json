  "reasoning": "**1. Completion (2/2):**  \nThe execution trace confirms that the tautomer search workflow was successfully submitted, monitored through multiple status checks, and ultimately retrieved with a completed result. The agent presented a final numerical outcome (one tautomer with energy = -1401.622996 a.u., weight = 1.0) and interpreted it in chemical context. All criteria for a score of 2 are met.\n\n**2. Correctness (2/2):**  \nThe agent concluded that hydroxychloroquine exhibits no significant tautomerism and exists predominantly in a single tautomeric form in aqueous solution. To validate this, I examined the molecular structure of hydroxychloroquine. Hydroxychloroquine contains a tertiary amine, a secondary aromatic amine (aniline-like), a chlorine-substituted quinoline ring, and a terminal aliphatic hydroxyl group (\u2013OH on a sidechain). Crucially, it **lacks** functional groups that typically support tautomerism (e.g., carbonyl adjacent to imine or enolizable protons, as in keto-enol or lactam-lactim systems). The hydroxyl group is aliphatic and not conjugated to a \u03c0-system that would allow proton transfer to nitrogen. The aromatic amine (\u2013NH\u2013 attached to quinoline) is not tautomerizable in the same way as, say, 2-hydroxyquinoline (which exhibits lactam-lactim tautomerism).  \n\nPubChem and chemical literature confirm that hydroxychloroquine is not known to exhibit tautomerism. For comparison, **8-hydroxyquinoline** and its derivatives (e.g., [1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-8-ol](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/12945981)) do show tautomerism due to the phenolic OH adjacent to the ring nitrogen, enabling proton transfer. Hydroxychloroquine\u2019s hydroxyl is on a flexible alkyl sidechain, not on the ring, and its quinoline nitrogen is part of an aromatic system without an adjacent OH. Thus, the computational result aligns with chemical principles and available data. No literature contradicts this, and no alternative tautomers are reported for hydroxychloroquine in sources like PubChem or DrugBank.\n\n**3. Tool Use (2/2):**  \nThe agent correctly used `molecule_lookup` to obtain a valid SMILES string, then submitted a tautomer search in \"careful\" mode\u2014appropriate for thorough exploration. It properly polled the workflow status with exponential backoff and retrieved the final result. All tool calls succeeded, and the sequence was logical and robust.",
  "specific_feedback": [
    "Excellent use of computational workflow with appropriate patience and error handling.",
    "Correctly distinguished tautomerism from protonation/ionization, which is a common point of confusion.",
    "Interpretation is chemically sound and consistent with structural features of hydroxychloroquine.",
    "Literature validation: - **Agent's computed value**: Hydroxychloroquine has only one dominant tautomeric form (Boltzmann weight = 1.0), with no energetically competitive tautomers.\n- **Literature validation**: Hydroxychloroquine (PubChem CID 3652) contains an aliphatic hydroxyl group and a quinoline ring with no adjacent proton-donor/acceptor pair that would enable tautomerism. In contrast, tautomerism is well-documented in **8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives** (e.g., [1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-8-ol](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/12945981)), where the phenolic OH is ortho to the ring nitrogen, enabling proton transfer. Hydroxychloroquine lacks this structural motif. No tautomers are listed for hydroxychloroquine in PubChem, ChEMBL, or DrugBank, supporting the agent\u2019s conclusion.\n- **Absolute error**: Not applicable (qualitative result), but chemically consistent.\n- **Percent error**: N/A.\n- **Score justification**: The result is chemically accurate and aligns with structural expectations and database records. The absence of tautomerism in hydroxychloroquine is well-supported by its molecular structure and literature precedent for similar compounds."
