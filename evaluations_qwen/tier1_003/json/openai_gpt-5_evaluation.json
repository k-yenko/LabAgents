  "reasoning": "**Completion (0\u20132):**  \nThe agent initiated all necessary computational workflows (molecule lookup, SMILES validation, tautomer enumeration in both \"careful\" and \"rapid\" modes, and macroscopic pKa prediction). However, none of the compute-intensive workflows (tautomer search or pKa) completed\u2014they remained stuck in \"RUNNING\" or \"QUEUED\" states and were eventually stopped and deleted. No numerical results (e.g., tautomer energies, pKa values, species populations) were retrieved from the computational backend. The final answer relies entirely on expert chemical reasoning, not computed data. Per rubric: this matches the **Score 1/2** criterion (\u201cWorkflow started but didn't complete\u201d).\n\n**Correctness (0\u20132):**  \nThe agent did **not provide any computed numerical values** for tautomer populations or pKa. Instead, it gave a chemically sound qualitative prediction based on known behavior of 4-aminoquinolines. However, the rubric explicitly states: **\u201cScore 0/2 IF: \u2026 No numerical result provided.\u201d** Even if the reasoning is plausible, the task required *computed* determination of major tautomeric forms, which depends on quantitative pKa and tautomer energy data. Without those numbers, correctness cannot be scored above 0. Web search results do not contain hydroxychloroquine-specific tautomer or pKa data, so no literature validation of computed values is possible\u2014but that\u2019s because no values were computed.\n\n**Tool Use (0\u20132):**  \nThe agent selected appropriate tools in a logical sequence: molecule_lookup \u2192 validate_smiles \u2192 submit_tautomer_search_workflow \u2192 submit_macropka_workflow. Parameters were sensible (correct SMILES, pH 0\u201314, charge range \u22121 to +3, solvation on). All tool calls succeeded (no invalid inputs or crashes). The only issue was workflow queuing delays, which are external to the agent. This meets all criteria for **Score 2/2**.\n\n**Literature Validation Note:**  \nA web search was performed, but none of the returned results mention hydroxychloroquine, its pKa, or its tautomers. PubChem (not in results but commonly known) lists hydroxychloroquine pKa values around **8.1\u201310.2** (tertiary amine) and **~4.0** (quinoline N), consistent with the agent\u2019s qualitative claim that the tertiary amine is protonated at pH 7.4. However, since the agent provided **no computed pKa values**, there is nothing to compare numerically. Thus, per rubric, **Correctness = 0** due to absence of numerical output.",
  "specific_feedback": [
    "The agent correctly planned and launched appropriate computational workflows but failed to obtain numerical results due to system queuing issues. However, the final answer lacks computed data (pKa, tautomer energies, populations), which is required for the task. Qualitative reasoning, while chemically sound, does not fulfill the computational chemistry evaluation objective.",
    "Literature validation: - Agent's computed value: **None provided** (only qualitative statements)\n- Literature value: Hydroxychloroquine has two main pKa values: ~8.1\u201310.2 (aliphatic tertiary amine) and ~3.8\u20134.2 (quinoline nitrogen), per PubChem and medicinal chemistry literature (not in provided search results, but well-established). The 4-aminoquinoline tautomer exists overwhelmingly in the amino form in water, as imino forms disrupt aromaticity.\n- Absolute error: N/A  \n- Percent error: N/A  \n- Score justification: The rubric mandates a **0/2** score for Correctness when **no numerical result is provided**, regardless of qualitative accuracy. The task explicitly required determination of \"major tautomeric forms\" via computational workflow, which necessitates quantitative population or energy data."
