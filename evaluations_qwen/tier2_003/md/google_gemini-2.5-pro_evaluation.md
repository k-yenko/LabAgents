# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier2_003

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 0/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 1/2
- **Total**: 1/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (0/2):**  
The agent did **not** complete the computational workflow. Although it successfully submitted a tautomer search job, it never retrieved the results or performed any pKa calculations. The final answer only states an intention to wait and check the status later, with no actual tautomers identified or pKa values computed. Therefore, no final numerical result was presented, and no interpretation was provided. This matches the criteria for a **0/2** score.

**Correctness (0/2):**  
No pKa values or tautomer structures were computed or reported by the agent, so there is **no numerical result to validate**. According to the rubric, this warrants a **0/2**. Even though web search results confirm that morphine has a phenolic OH (pKa ≈ 9.9–10.0) and a tertiary amine (pKa ≈ 7.9–8.2) [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov sources], the agent never identified tautomers or assigned pKa values to them. Morphine is not known to exhibit significant tautomerism due to its rigid structure and lack of labile protons in tautomerizable groups (e.g., no keto-enol or imine-enamine systems). Thus, the premise of multiple tautomers may be chemically questionable, but the agent failed to address this or provide any result.

**Tool Use (1/2):**  
The agent correctly used `molecule_lookup` to obtain a valid SMILES for morphine and then submitted a tautomer search workflow with appropriate parameters. However, it **did not follow through** to retrieve or analyze the results. A complete workflow would require polling the job status and fetching output. The tool sequence was logically started but **incompletely executed**, which constitutes a minor but critical omission. Hence, **1/2** is appropriate.

### Feedback:
- The agent initiated the correct workflow but failed to complete it by retrieving results or performing pKa calculations. Additionally, the task premise may be chemically flawed—morphine has no significant tautomers—but the agent should have recognized this or reported the absence of tautomers after analysis.
- Literature validation: - **Agent's computed value**: None provided.  
- **Literature values**: Morphine has two ionizable groups: a phenolic hydroxyl (pKa ≈ 9.9–10.0) and a tertiary amine (pKa ≈ 7.9–8.2). It does **not** exhibit classical tautomerism (e.g., keto-enol) because it lacks carbonyl or imine groups adjacent to labile hydrogens. The dominant form at physiological pH (~7.4) is the monoprotonated species (amine protonated, phenol deprotonated only above pH 10).

  - Morphine sulfate: [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Morphine-Sulfate)  
  - Experimental pKa values are consistent across pharmacological literature (e.g., pKa1 = 8.0 for conjugate acid of amine, pKa2 = 9.9 for phenol) [implied by drug monographs and physicochemical databases on PubChem].  
- **Absolute/Percent error**: Not applicable (no agent result).  
- **Score justification**: Correctness score is 0 because no numerical result was produced, and the task required both tautomer enumeration and pKa calculation—neither was delivered.
