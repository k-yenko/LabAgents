# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier2_003

## Overall: PASS

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 2/2
- **Correctness**: 1/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total**: 5/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (2/2):**  
The agent successfully executed a full computational workflow:  
- Retrieved morphine’s SMILES via `molecule_lookup`  
- Submitted and completed a tautomer search (`submit_tautomer_search_workflow`)  
- Retrieved tautomer results showing only one dominant tautomer  
- Submitted and completed a pKa calculation (`submit_pka_workflow`)  
- Retrieved pKa results with two ionizable sites (pKa = 7.27 and 10.27)  
- Interpreted the results in the context of physiological pH (7.4)  
All steps finished with successful status codes, and final numerical results were presented and analyzed.

**Correctness (1/2):**  
The agent reports two pKa values:  
- Basic pKa (tertiary amine): **7.27**  
- Acidic pKa (phenolic OH): **10.27**

Literature validation:  
- Experimental pKa of morphine’s conjugate acid (i.e., protonated amine) is **~8.0–8.2** (commonly cited as **8.21**)  
- Phenolic pKa is **~9.9–10.0** (often **9.96**)  

Sources:  
- PubChem lists morphine with pKa values of **8.21** (basic) and **9.96** (acidic) [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5479215)  
- HMDB also references similar values consistent with these ranges [hmdb.ca](https://www.hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0014440)

Error analysis:  
- Amine pKa error: |7.27 – 8.21| = **0.94 units** → ~11.5% error  
- Phenol pKa error: |10.27 – 9.96| = **0.31 units** → ~3.1% error  

While the phenolic pKa is well within acceptable error (±0.5), the amine pKa is **0.94 units off**, which exceeds the ±0.5 threshold for a score of 2. This falls into the **1/2** range (0.5–1.5 unit error).

**Tool Use (2/2):**  
The agent used tools appropriately:  
- Correctly obtained SMILES for morphine  
- Chose “careful” mode for tautomer search (appropriate for accuracy)  
- Set reasonable pKa range [2,12] covering both acidic and basic sites  
- Used correct workflow sequence: lookup → tautomer search → pKa calculation → result retrieval  
- Handled timeouts gracefully with retries  
All tools executed successfully after retries, and parameters were valid.

### Feedback:
- The tautomer analysis is chemically sound—morphine indeed lacks significant tautomerism.
- However, the computed amine pKa (7.27) is notably lower than the accepted experimental value (~8.21), likely due to limitations of the rapid pKa estimation method. A higher-accuracy mode might improve this.
- Overall workflow execution and interpretation were excellent.
- Literature validation: - **Agent's computed values**:  
  - Basic pKa (amine): **7.27**  
  - Acidic pKa (phenol): **10.27**

- **Literature values**:  
  - Basic pKa: **8.21** [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5479215)  
  - Acidic pKa: **9.96** [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5479215), consistent with [HMDB](https://www.hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0014440)

- **Absolute errors**:  
  - Amine: |7.27 – 8.21| = **0.94**  
  - Phenol: |10.27 – 9.96| = **0.31**

- **Percent errors**:  
  - Amine: (0.94 / 8.21) × 100 ≈ **11.4%**  
  - Phenol: (0.31 / 9.96) × 100 ≈ **3.1%**

- **Score justification**:  
  The phenolic pKa is accurate (within ±0.5), but the amine pKa is off by 0.94 units, exceeding the ±0.5 tolerance for full credit. This qualifies for **1/2** on correctness.
