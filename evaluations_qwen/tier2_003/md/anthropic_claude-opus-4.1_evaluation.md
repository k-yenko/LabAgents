# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier2_003

## Overall: PASS

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 2/2
- **Correctness**: 1/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total**: 5/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (2/2):**  
The agent successfully executed a full computational workflow:  
- Retrieved morphine’s SMILES via `molecule_lookup`  
- Submitted and completed a tautomer search (`submit_tautomer_search_workflow`)  
- Retrieved tautomer results and confirmed only one dominant tautomer  
- Submitted and completed a pKa calculation workflow (`submit_pka_workflow`)  
- Retrieved pKa results and interpreted them in the context of physiological pH  
All steps finished with “COMPLETED_OK” status, and final numerical pKa values (7.53 and 10.33) were presented with clear interpretation. ✅

**Correctness (1/2):**  
The agent reports two pKa values:  
- Basic pKa (tertiary amine): **7.53**  
- Acidic pKa (phenolic OH): **10.33**

From literature:  
- Experimental pKa of morphine’s conjugate acid (i.e., protonated amine) is **~8.0–8.25** [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5288826) lists pKa = **8.21** (at 25°C).  
- Phenolic OH pKa is **~9.9–10.0**; for example, [Kaufman et al., J. Med. Chem. (1975)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm00241a001) reports morphine phenolic pKa ≈ **9.96**.

Thus:  
- Amine pKa error: |7.53 – 8.21| = **0.68** → exceeds ±0.5 threshold  
- Phenolic pKa error: |10.33 – 9.96| = **0.37** → acceptable

Because the **basic pKa is off by 0.68 units** (>0.5), and this is the most pharmacologically relevant value (governs ionization at pH 7.4), the result falls into the **1/2** correctness category. The error leads to a modest overestimation of the neutral fraction (agent says 43% neutral; true value is ~30% at pKa 8.21).

**Tool Use (2/2):**  
The agent used appropriate tools in logical sequence:  
- Correctly obtained canonical SMILES  
- Chose “rapid” mode appropriately for initial screening  
- Properly waited and polled workflow status  
- Retrieved molecule and pKa data correctly  
- Parameters (pKa range [0,14], default deprotonation elements) were sensible  
All tool calls succeeded with valid inputs and outputs. No errors or inefficiencies. ✅

### Feedback:
- The workflow was well-executed, but using a higher-accuracy pKa mode would improve quantitative reliability, especially for the pharmacologically critical amine pKa.
- Literature validation: - **Agent's computed pKa (basic):** 7.53  
- **Literature pKa (basic):** 8.21 ([PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5288826))  
- **Absolute error:** |7.53 – 8.21| = 0.68  
- **Percent error:** (0.68 / 8.21) × 100 ≈ 8.3%  

- **Agent's computed pKa (acidic):** 10.33  
- **Literature pKa (acidic):** 9.96 ([Kaufman et al., J. Med. Chem. 1975](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm00241a001))  
- **Absolute error:** 0.37  
- **Percent error:** ~3.7%  

While the phenolic pKa is accurate, the amine pKa error (0.68 units) exceeds the ±0.5 threshold for full correctness. This likely stems from the “rapid” pKa mode’s lower accuracy. Still, the qualitative conclusion (mixture of protonated/neutral forms at pH 7.4) remains valid.
