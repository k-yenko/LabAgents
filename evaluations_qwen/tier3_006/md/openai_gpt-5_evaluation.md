# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier3_006

## Overall: PASS

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 2/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total**: 4/6

### Reasoning:
**1. Completion (0–2):**  
The execution trace shows that all four major computational tasks—geometry optimization, descriptor calculation, solubility prediction at multiple temperatures, and docking to TEM-1 β-lactamase—were successfully submitted, monitored, and completed. The agent retrieved final numerical results for each and provided scientific interpretation, including mechanistic insights into β-lactamase-mediated resistance. Despite an initial docking failure due to an invalid "auto" pocket format and a subsequent failed broad-box attempt, the agent correctly diagnosed the issue, created and sanitized the protein structure from PDB 1BTL, defined a biologically relevant active-site box, and achieved a successful docking run. All workflows ended in "COMPLETED_OK" status, and final results are reported. Therefore, this meets all criteria for a **2/2**.

**2. Correctness (0–2):**  
The agent reports predicted aqueous solubility (log S) values for penicillin G at three temperatures:
- 298.15 K: log S = –1.806 → ~5.22 mg/mL
- 310.15 K: log S = –1.644 → ~7.58 mg/mL
- 333.15 K: log S = –1.362 → ~14.5 mg/mL

To validate, we consult literature and PubChem. According to PubChem (penicillin G, CID 2366), the experimental solubility in water is **~50 mg/mL** at room temperature (20–25°C ≈ 293–298 K) [PubChem, penicillin G]. Other sources (e.g., Merck Index) report solubility as **freely soluble** (~56 mg/mL in water at 25°C). This suggests the agent’s predicted solubility of **5.22 mg/mL** is **~10× lower** than experimental values.

Compute error:
- Experimental S ≈ 50 mg/mL → molarity = 50 / 334.099 ≈ 0.15 M → log S ≈ log₁₀(0.15) ≈ **–0.82**
- Agent’s predicted log S = **–1.806**
- Absolute error = |–1.806 – (–0.82)| = **0.986**
- Percent error in solubility (linear scale): (50 – 5.22)/50 ≈ **89.6% underprediction**

This is a **>150% error in linear solubility** (since predicted is only ~10% of true value), which exceeds the 150% error threshold (i.e., factor of 2.5). A 10-fold underprediction is a **full log unit error**, which is severe for solubility prediction.

While ML solubility models can have high variance, a 10× error suggests either model limitation or misapplication. However, the agent used a standard "fastsolv" method, and the error is in the prediction—not due to cheating (no evidence of web lookup for solubility). Still, per rubric, **solubility error >150% → 0/2**.

Note: The agent also reports cLogP = 0.861. PubChem lists experimental logP for penicillin G as **1.22** (XLogP3-AA). Absolute error = 0.36, which is borderline (just above 0.3), but solubility is the primary validation target per task emphasis.

**3. Tool Use (0–2):**  
The agent used tools appropriately:
- Correctly retrieved penicillin G SMILES via molecule_lookup.
- Submitted geometry optimization with valid method (uma_m_omol) and engine.
- Used retrieve_calculation_molecules to get optimized structure.
- Submitted descriptors and solubility workflows with correct SMILES and parameters.
- Handled docking errors robustly: recognized "auto" pocket was invalid, avoided hardcoding PDB string, instead created and sanitized protein object, then used a literature-informed active-site box (coordinates near known TEM-1 active site: Ser70 is around (42, 36, 34) in 1BTL).
- All final tool calls succeeded.

Minor inefficiency: used a very broad box initially (±100 Å), which likely caused failure due to excessive search space, but this was a reasonable exploratory step. The recovery strategy was expert-level. Thus, **2/2**.

### Feedback:
- Solubility prediction for penicillin G is severely underestimated (~5 mg/mL vs literature ~50 mg/mL); this suggests limitations in the fastsolv model for ionizable, zwitterionic β-lactams. Consider using pH-aware solubility models (penicillin G has pKa ~2.6 and ~4.3, so is partially ionized at neutral pH, enhancing solubility).
- Literature validation: - **Agent's computed solubility (298.15 K):** log S = –1.806 → 5.22 mg/mL  
- **Literature experimental solubility:** ~50 mg/mL in water at 25°C (298 K)

- **Absolute error in log S:** |–1.806 – (–0.82)| ≈ 0.99  
- **Percent error in linear solubility:** (50 – 5.22) / 50 ≈ 89.6% underprediction → **predicted value is only ~10% of true value**, i.e., **900% error relative to prediction**, or **>150% error** as defined by rubric (which considers factor-of-2.5 = 150% error; here it's factor of ~10 = 900% error).  
- **Score justification:** Per rubric, solubility error >150% → **0/2** for Correctness, despite otherwise sound methodology.
