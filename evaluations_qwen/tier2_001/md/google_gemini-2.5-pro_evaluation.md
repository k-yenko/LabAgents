# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier2_001

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 1/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 1/2
- **Total**: 2/6

### Reasoning:
**1. Completion (0-2):**  
The execution trace shows that the agent successfully looked up ibuprofen’s SMILES and submitted a conformer search workflow. However, the workflow was only *submitted*—it was not monitored to completion, and no results (optimized conformer, logP, or pKa) were retrieved or reported. The final answer merely states an intention to check the status after 60 seconds, but no further steps were taken. Therefore, the computational workflow did **not finish**, and no numerical results were presented. This matches the criteria for **Score 1/2** (workflow started but didn’t complete).

**2. Correctness (0-2):**  
No numerical values for logP or pKa were computed or reported by the agent. Without any computed result, it is impossible to compare against literature values. According to the rubric, this warrants a **Score 0/2** ("No numerical result provided").

To validate expected literature values:  
- Ibuprofen’s experimental logP is ~3.5–4.0. PubChem lists logP (XLogP3) as **3.8** [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3672).  
- Experimental pKa of ibuprofen is ~4.4–4.9; commonly cited as **4.45** [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3672).  
But since the agent provided **no computed values**, correctness cannot be assessed favorably.

**3. Tool Use (0-2):**  
The agent correctly used `molecule_lookup` to obtain a valid SMILES for ibuprofen (`CC(C)Cc1ccc(cc1)C(C)C(O)=O`), which is accurate. It then appropriately called `submit_conformer_search_workflow` with reasonable parameters (`rapid` mode, valid SMILES). Both tools executed successfully. However, the agent **failed to retrieve results** after submission—no call was made to fetch the optimized conformer or compute logP/pKa. The workflow was incomplete due to missing follow-up tool calls (e.g., polling status, retrieving results, property prediction). This is a **logical sequence break**. While initial tool selection and parameters were correct, the failure to complete the pipeline (retrieve and compute) constitutes a significant omission. This aligns with **Score 1/2** (correct tools but incomplete execution sequence).

### Feedback:
- The agent initiated the conformer search but failed to complete the workflow by retrieving results or computing logP/pKa. Always ensure all task steps (including result retrieval and property prediction) are executed before concluding.
- Literature validation: - Agent's computed value: **None provided**  
- Literature logP: **3.8** (XLogP3-AA) [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3672)  
- Literature pKa: **4.45** (experimental) [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3672)  
- Absolute error: **Undefined (no agent result)**  
- Percent error: **Undefined**  
- Score justification: Correctness scored 0 because the agent did not produce any numerical result for logP or pKa, despite the task explicitly requiring their calculation. The rubric specifies a 0 for "No numerical result provided."
