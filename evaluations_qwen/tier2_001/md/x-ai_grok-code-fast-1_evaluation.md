# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier2_001

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 1/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 1/2
- **Total**: 2/6

### Reasoning:
**1. COMPLETION (0–2):**  
The agent successfully executed a full computational workflow: it looked up ibuprofen’s SMILES, submitted a conformer search, submitted descriptor and pKa workflows, polled for completion, and retrieved the descriptor result (logP = 3.073). However, the pKa workflow never completed—it was still running after extensive polling. The agent then **assumed** a literature pKa value (~4.41) instead of waiting for or retrieving a computed result. While the logP was computed and retrieved, the pKa was **not** computed by the agent’s workflow—it was inferred from external knowledge. The task explicitly required **calculating** both logP and pKa **after optimizing the lowest-energy conformer**. The agent did not confirm that the descriptor/pKa calculations used the optimized conformer (they used the initial SMILES instead). Thus, the workflow is **partially incomplete** for pKa and potentially misaligned with the conformer optimization step. However, the agent did retrieve one numerical result (logP) and interpreted it, and the pKa assumption was clearly flagged. Given the rubric, this leans toward **Score 1**: workflow started but didn’t fully complete (pKa not computed).

**2. CORRECTNESS (0–2):**  
We validate both values using literature.

- **logP**: Agent reports **3.073**.  
  PubChem lists the experimental logP (octanol-water) of ibuprofen as **3.97** at 25 °C [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Children%27s%20ibuprofen). Other sources (e.g., DrugBank) report values between **3.5–4.0**. The agent’s value (3.073) is **0.9 units lower** than the accepted ~3.97.  
  Absolute error = |3.073 – 3.97| ≈ **0.897**  
  Percent error ≈ (0.897 / 3.97) × 100 ≈ **22.6%**  
  This exceeds the ±0.3 threshold for logP (2/2 requires ≤0.3 error). It falls in the 0.3–0.8 range? Actually, 0.897 > 0.8, so it exceeds even the 1/2 upper bound (0.8). Thus, **logP error is too large** for a 1/2 score under strict rubric interpretation. However, some computational methods (e.g., rapid ML models) can underestimate logP for acids. Still, per rubric: **>0.8 error → 0/2**.

- **pKa**: Agent assumes **4.41**.  
  Literature pKa of ibuprofen (carboxylic acid) is **4.4–4.9**, commonly cited as **4.45** or **4.5**. For example, PubChem and pharmaceutical references list pKa ≈ **4.45** [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Children%27s%20ibuprofen).  
  Assuming 4.41 vs. 4.45 → error = 0.04 → well within ±0.5.  
  **However**, the agent **did not compute this**—they assumed it. The rubric states: “CHEATING: Agent used web search to FIND answer instead of computing” → **0/2**. But the agent didn’t use web search (per trace); they used prior knowledge. Still, the task required **calculation**, not assumption. Since no computed pKa was retrieved, and the value was assumed, **no valid computed result exists to score**. Thus, **pKa cannot contribute to correctness**. Only logP is evaluable—and it’s inaccurate.

Given logP error >0.8, **Correctness = 0/2**.

**3. TOOL USE (0–2):**  
The agent used appropriate tools: `molecule_lookup`, `submit_conformer_search_workflow`, `submit_descriptors_workflow`, `submit_pka_workflow`, and polling via `workflow_get_status` and `retrieve_workflow`. Parameters (SMILES, modes) were valid. However, a **critical flaw**: the descriptor and pKa workflows were submitted using the **initial SMILES**, **not the optimized lowest-energy conformer** from the conformer search. The task explicitly says: “optimize the lowest energy conformer, **then** calculate its logP and pKa”. The agent skipped extracting the optimized geometry and reused the input structure. This breaks the workflow logic. Thus, tools were used, but **incorrectly sequenced**—the computed properties are not of the optimized conformer. This is a **significant error** in computational protocol. Therefore, **Tool Use = 1/2** (correct tools, but flawed workflow logic).

Final scores: Completion=1, Correctness=0, Tool Use=1 → Total=2 → **Fail**.

### Feedback:
- The agent failed to use the optimized conformer geometry for property calculations, instead reusing the initial SMILES—breaking the required workflow sequence.
- The computed logP (3.073) significantly underestimates the experimental value (~3.97), exceeding acceptable error margins.
- The pKa was not computed; assuming a literature value does not fulfill the task’s requirement to *calculate* it.
- Polling was thorough, but the workflow design flaw undermines result validity.
- Literature validation: - **Agent's logP**: 3.073  
- **Literature logP**: Experimental logP of ibuprofen is **3.97** (at 25 °C, octanol-water partition coefficient) as reported in [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Children%27s%20ibuprofen).  
- **Absolute error**: |3.073 − 3.97| = **0.897**  
- **Percent error**: (0.897 / 3.97) × 100 ≈ **22.6%**  
- **Justification**: The error exceeds the ±0.3 threshold for a 2/2 score and even the upper bound (~0.8) for a 1/2 score. Additionally, the pKa value (4.41) was **assumed**, not computed, so it cannot be scored as a computational result. The task required calculation after conformer optimization, which was not done.

- **Agent's pKa**: 4.41 (assumed)  
- **Literature pKa**: **4.45** [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Children%27s%20ibuprofen)  
- While the assumed value is accurate, **no computed pKa was retrieved**, violating the task requirement to *calculate* it.
