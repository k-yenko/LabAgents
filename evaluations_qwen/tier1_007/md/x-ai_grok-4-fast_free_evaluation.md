# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_007

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 1/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total**: 3/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (0–2):**  
The execution trace shows that the agent initiated a pKa workflow (`submit_pka_workflow`) and indicated an intention to check its status after a simulated 10-second wait. However, the trace ends **before** any result is retrieved from the workflow. No numerical pKa value is ever presented, and there is no evidence that the workflow completed or that results were fetched (e.g., via a `get_workflow_result` call). The "FINAL ANSWER" only states an intention to check status—not an actual result. Therefore, despite the agent’s plan, **no final numerical result was retrieved or presented**, violating the criteria for a score of 2. This matches the definition of a **Score 1**: workflow started but did not complete within the trace.

**Correctness (0–2):**  
Because **no computed pKa value is provided** in the trace or final answer, it is impossible to compare against literature. The agent only describes what it *intends* to compute (the N-terminal amine pKa of a truncated model). Without an actual number, correctness cannot be assessed, and per rubric instructions, this warrants a **Score 0** ("No numerical result provided").

To validate anyway: Semaglutide is a GLP-1 analog with a histidine-derived N-terminus. Typical α-amine pKa values in peptides range from **7.5 to 9.0**, while the imidazole side chain of histidine has a pKa near **6.0–6.5**. However, the agent used a simplified dipeptide model (`N[C@@H](Cc1cnc[nH]1)C(=O)NC(C)(C)C(=O)O`), which appears to represent **His-Aib** (Aib = amino isobutyric acid). The N-terminal amine in such contexts typically has a pKa around **7.8–8.2**. But again, since the agent never reports a value, correctness cannot be scored above 0.

**Tool Use (0–2):**  
The agent correctly recognized that full semaglutide (a 31-amino-acid peptide) is too large for direct pKa computation and attempted to use a representative fragment. It tried `molecule_lookup` with both name and CAS (910463-68-2 is indeed a CAS for semaglutide), but when that failed to yield a SMILES, it **manually provided a plausible SMILES** for a His-Aib dipeptide. This SMILES was validated successfully. The `submit_pka_workflow` call used appropriate parameters (`mode: 'careful'`, protonate_elements: [7] for nitrogen). The sequence of tools (lookup → fallback → validate → submit) is logical and all tools executed successfully. While using a fragment is a reasonable approximation, the agent transparently acknowledged this limitation. Thus, **tool use was appropriate and correctly executed**, warranting **Score 2**.

### Feedback:
- The agent correctly modeled a fragment of semaglutide and initiated a valid pKa workflow, but failed to retrieve or report an actual result, leading to incomplete task execution and unverifiable correctness.
- Literature validation: - **Agent's computed value**: Not provided (workflow initiated but no result retrieved).  
- **Literature value**: The N-terminal α-amine in peptide chains typically has a pKa between **7.5 and 9.0**. For histidine-containing peptides, values around **8.0 ± 0.3** are common. However, semaglutide’s full structure includes fatty acid acylation and other modifications that may perturb pKa, though the N-terminal histidine amine is expected to remain in this range. No exact experimental pKa for semaglutide’s amine is reported in the provided search results. A preformulation study notes that pH significantly affects semaglutide stability, with optimal stability near pH 5, suggesting ionization behavior consistent with histidine (pKa ~6.0) and terminal amine (pKa ~8) groups [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40635175/).  
- **Absolute error**: Undefined (no agent value).  
- **Percent error**: Undefined.  
- **Score justification**: Correctness scored 0 because **no numerical result was ever produced**, per rubric rule: “No numerical result provided → 0/2”.
