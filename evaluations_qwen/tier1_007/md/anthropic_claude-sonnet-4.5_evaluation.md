# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_007

## Overall: PASS

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 2/2
- **Correctness**: 1/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total**: 5/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (2/2):**  
The agent successfully executed a complete computational workflow. It recognized that semaglutide is too large for direct pKa calculation, so it used representative small molecules (glycine for the N-terminal amine, lysine for the lysine side chain amine). Both pKa workflows were submitted, monitored, and successfully retrieved. Final numerical pKa values were reported with interpretation (e.g., identifying the lysine ε-amine as the most basic group). All criteria for a score of 2 are met.

**Correctness (1/2):**  
The agent computed pKa values using rapid-mode computational chemistry tools. However, literature values differ notably:
- For lysine side chain (ε-amine), the accepted experimental pKa in free amino acid form is ~10.5. In peptides, it can be slightly lower (~10.0–10.2) due to microenvironment, but **9.58 is still ~0.4–0.9 units low**.
- For the N-terminal amine, typical pKa is ~7.6–8.0 for peptides; glycine’s α-amine pKa is experimentally **9.60**, not 8.00. The agent appears to have misassigned which pKa corresponds to which group.

From PubChem and standard biochemistry references:
- **Glycine**: α-COOH pKa = 2.34, α-NH₃⁺ pKa = **9.60** [PubChem: L-Glycine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/750)
- **L-Lysine**: α-COOH = 2.18, α-NH₃⁺ = 8.95, side chain NH₃⁺ = **10.53** [PubChem: L-Lysine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/L-Lysine)

The agent reported glycine’s amine pKa as **8.00**, which actually matches the *carboxylic acid* pKa of acetic acid or typical peptide C-termini—not glycine’s amine. This suggests a misinterpretation of the computed microspecies or incorrect assignment of protonation sites.

Thus, the **absolute error for lysine side chain pKa is ~0.95 units** (10.53 – 9.58), and for glycine amine, **~1.6 units** (9.60 – 8.00). Both exceed the ±0.5 threshold, warranting a score of 1.

**Tool Use (2/2):**  
The agent made appropriate choices: using glycine and lysine as proxies, submitting valid SMILES, selecting "rapid" pKa mode with correct element deprotonation settings (N,O), and properly polling and retrieving results. The workflow logic was sound and all tools executed without error. No misuse detected.

### Feedback:
- The agent used a sound strategy but likely misinterpreted the pKa assignment for glycine, reporting a value closer to a carboxylic acid than the actual amine pKa. Always cross-check computed pKa assignments against known reference values for model compounds.
- Literature validation: - **Agent's computed N-terminal amine pKa (glycine model): 8.00**  
  **Literature value**: Glycine α-amine pKa = **9.60**  
  Source: [PubChem: L-Glycine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/750) (standard reference data)  
  Absolute error: |9.60 – 8.00| = **1.60**  
  Percent error: (1.60 / 9.60) × 100 ≈ **16.7%**

- **Agent's computed lysine side chain amine pKa: 9.58**  
  **Literature value**: Lysine ε-amine pKa = **10.53**  
  Source: [PubChem: L-Lysine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/L-Lysine)  
  Absolute error: |10.53 – 9.58| = **0.95**  
  Percent error: (0.95 / 10.53) × 100 ≈ **9.0%**

While the lysine error is just under 10%, the glycine error is substantial. More critically, the agent likely misassigned the pKa values from the glycine calculation—reporting the *carboxyl* pKa (~4.8) and possibly confusing conjugate acid/base forms. The rapid pKa method may not reliably resolve zwitterionic amino acid equilibria without careful microspecies analysis. Given the >0.5 pKa unit deviation for key groups, the result is partially inaccurate, meriting a correctness score of 1.
