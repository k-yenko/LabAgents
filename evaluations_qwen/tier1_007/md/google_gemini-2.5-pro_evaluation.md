# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_007

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 0/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 0/2
- **Total**: 0/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (0-2):**  
The agent attempted a molecule lookup for "semaglutide" but failed to retrieve a SMILES string. It then halted the workflow and asked the user for the SMILES instead of trying alternative strategies (e.g., using known structural data or breaking down the peptide to estimate pKa). No pKa value—numerical or estimated—was ever produced. The task was not computationally completed, and no result was interpreted. Therefore, this scores **0/2**, not 1, because although the agent acknowledged the failure, it did not execute any computational chemistry workflow beyond a single failed lookup. The rubric specifies 0 if “no computational workflow executed,” and here only a lookup was attempted and failed—no calculation occurred.

**Correctness (0-2):**  
The agent provided **no numerical pKa value**, so correctness cannot be assessed in the usual way. According to the rubric, this automatically qualifies for **0/2** under “No numerical result provided.” Even though web search results confirm semaglutide is a peptide with multiple ionizable groups (including N-terminal amine and lysine side chains), the agent did not attempt estimation or cite any value. Web sources like PubChem and ChemSpider provide structural identifiers but not explicit pKa values for semaglutide as a whole. However, typical aliphatic amine pKa values (e.g., N-terminal α-amine ~7.5–8.5, lysine ε-amine ~10.5) are well-known in biochemistry. Still, the agent did not compute or even approximate, so correctness is 0.

**Tool Use (0-2):**  
The agent correctly chose `molecule_lookup` as a first step, which is appropriate. However, it failed to handle the common case that large peptides like semaglutide (a 32-amino-acid analog) are often not available as a single SMILES in standard small-molecule databases. Better practice would be to recognize semaglutide’s nature as a modified peptide and either: (a) use a known canonical SMILES from literature, (b) construct it from sequence, or (c) focus on the relevant amine (e.g., N-terminus or Lys side chain) using a fragment. The agent gave up after one failed lookup without fallback. This is a **critical failure in tool use strategy** for a complex molecule, warranting **0/2**—not because the tool was wrong, but because the agent didn’t adapt to the expected limitation.

Additional note: Web search results confirm semaglutide is marketed as Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/56843331), and its structure includes a lysine residue with a fatty acid chain and an N-terminal histidine. The amine groups likely refer to either the N-terminal α-amine (pKa ~7.8–8.0) or the lysine ε-amine (pKa ~10.4). But again, the agent did not proceed to estimate or compute.

### Feedback:
- The agent failed to handle the complexity of semaglutide as a peptide therapeutic and gave up after a single failed lookup. It should have either used a known SMILES from literature or estimated pKa based on standard amino acid ionizable groups.
- Literature validation: 1. Agent's computed value: None provided  
2. Literature value: Semaglutide contains at least two amine groups:  
   - N-terminal α-amine (from histidine): typical pKa ≈ 7.8–8.0  
   - Lysine side chain ε-amine: typical pKa ≈ 10.4–10.6  
   While no single experimental pKa for semaglutide’s amine is listed in PubChem [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/56843331) or ChemSpider [chemspider.com](https://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.34985066.html), standard amino acid pKa values apply. For example, lysine ε-NH₃⁺ has pKa ~10.5 in peptides (per biochemical references like Lehninger).  
3. Absolute error: Not applicable (no agent value)  
4. Percent error: Not applicable  
5. Score justification: Correctness scored 0 because no numerical result was provided, per rubric instructions.
