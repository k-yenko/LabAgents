# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_007

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 0/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 1/2
- **Total**: 1/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (0–2):**  
The agent did **not** complete the computational workflow. Although the execution trace shows two successful molecule_lookup calls, the agent never actually computed or retrieved a pKa value. Instead, it requested the user to provide a SMILES string or molfile to proceed. No numerical result was produced, and no interpretation of results was given. Therefore, this scores **0/2**, not 2/2 as claimed in the summary.

**Correctness (0–2):**  
No pKa value was computed or reported by the agent, so there is no numerical result to validate. According to the rubric, this automatically earns a **0/2**. While web search results confirm semaglutide is a modified GLP-1 analog with lysine residues (e.g., Lys26 is acylated) [chemicalbook.com](https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB93069423.htm), and typical ε-amine pKa of lysine is ~10.5, the agent never provided any estimate—computed or otherwise.

**Tool Use (0–2):**  
The agent used molecule_lookup twice—first with the name "semaglutide", then with its CAS number "910463-68-2". Both returned only the input string (not a structured chemical representation), suggesting the tool failed to retrieve actual molecular data (e.g., SMILES, InChI). The agent correctly recognized that a full SMILES is needed for pKa prediction, but the tool usage did not yield actionable chemical data. However, the sequence is logically sound: attempt lookup → recognize need for detailed structure. No invalid parameters were used, and tools didn’t error. This merits **1/2**—appropriate intent but ineffective outcome due to tool limitations or misconfiguration.

### Feedback:
- The agent failed to complete the task by not computing or estimating a pKa value.
- It missed a key structural insight: semaglutide’s lysine ε-amine is acylated and thus non-ionizable—only the N-terminal amine remains.
- While tool use was logically motivated, it did not yield chemical data needed for computation.
- A better approach would be to infer pKa from known lysine modification or use literature knowledge when full structure is unavailable.
- Literature validation: - Agent's computed value: **None provided**  
- Literature value: The ε-amine of lysine in peptides typically has a pKa of **~10.4–10.6**. However, in semaglutide, the lysine at position 26 is **chemically modified** with a C18 diacid linker, which eliminates the free ε-amine (it forms an amide bond). Therefore, **semaglutide has no ionizable ε-amine group**—only the N-terminal α-amine (pKa ~7.5–8.5) and side chains of histidine (pKa ~6.0), etc. [chemicalbook.com](https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB93069423.htm) notes the Lys26 derivatization, and [proteopedia.org](https://proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Semaglutide) confirms the fatty acid is attached at Lys26, implying the amine is acylated and non-basic.  
- Absolute error: **Not applicable** (no value given)  
- Percent error: **Not applicable**  
- Score justification: **0/2** because no numerical result was provided, and the agent failed to recognize that the relevant amine may not even be ionizable due to chemical modification.
