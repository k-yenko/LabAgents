# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_007

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 0/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 0/2
- **Total**: 0/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (0–2):**  
The agent never produced a final numerical pKa value. Despite correctly identifying that semaglutide’s N-terminus is modified with Aib (α-aminoisobutyric acid), it failed to compute or retrieve the pKa of the amine group. The workflow ended without a result, and the "Final Answer" is empty. Therefore, it does **not** meet the criteria for a score of 2. However, the agent did execute a computational workflow (multiple tool calls, reasoning steps), so it’s not a total failure. But per the rubric: “Final numerical result was retrieved and presented” is required for a 2. Since no pKa value was ever output, **Completion = 0**.

**Correctness (0–2):**  
No numerical pKa value was provided by the agent, so there is nothing to validate. The rubric explicitly states: “No numerical result provided” → **Correctness = 0**.

**Tool Use (0–2):**  
The agent repeatedly called an "unknown_tool", which does not exist, indicating a failure in tool selection. It correctly used molecule_lookup for glycine and got a valid SMILES, and validate_smiles worked once. However, for the target molecule (semaglutide or Aib), it either got no SMILES or resorted to guessing a SMILES string (`CC(C)(C(=O)O)N`) but never validated it with validate_smiles (it tried to use unknown_tool instead). The correct SMILES for Aib is `CC(C)(N)C(=O)O` or canonical form `CC(N)(C)C(=O)O`. The agent’s guessed SMILES `CC(C)(C(=O)O)N` is chemically equivalent but nonstandard; however, the bigger issue is the repeated use of a non-existent tool. This constitutes **wrong tool selection and invalid workflow**, so **Tool Use = 0**.

**Literature Validation:**  
Semaglutide’s N-terminus is acetylated and starts with Aib (α-aminoisobutyric acid), which is a non-proteinogenic amino acid with a **tertiary alpha carbon and a primary amine**. However, because the alpha carbon is quaternary (no H), the amine is still primary but sterically hindered. Literature shows that the pKa of the α-amine in Aib is **approximately 9.7–10.0**, slightly higher than alanine (~9.7) due to the electron-donating methyl groups. According to PubChem and chemical databases, α-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) has pKa values of ~2.3 (carboxyl) and **~9.8 (amine)** [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pccompound?cmd=search&term=alpha-aminoisobutyric+acid). But again, the agent never provided any value to compare.

Since no value was given, correctness cannot be scored above 0.

### Feedback:
- The agent failed to produce any pKa value despite extensive reasoning. It repeatedly used a non-existent "unknown_tool", indicating poor tool management. It should have either constructed and validated the SMILES for Aib using available tools (molecule_lookup, validate_smiles) or acknowledged the limitation and provided an estimate based on chemical analogy with proper citation.
- Literature validation: - Agent's computed value: None provided  
- Literature value: The pKa of the amine group in α-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib), the N-terminal residue of semaglutide, is approximately **9.8** [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pccompound?cmd=search&term=alpha-aminoisobutyric+acid). Additional confirmation from chemical literature indicates Aib amine pKa ranges from **9.7 to 10.0** due to the +I effect of two methyl groups increasing basicity slightly compared to alanine.  
- Absolute error: Not applicable (no agent value)  
- Percent error: Not applicable  
- Score justification: Correctness score is 0 because no numerical result was provided, per rubric instructions.
