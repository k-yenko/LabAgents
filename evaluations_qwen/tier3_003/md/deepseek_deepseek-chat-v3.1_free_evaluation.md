# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier3_003

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 2/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 1/2
- **Total**: 3/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (2/2):**  
The agent successfully executed the full computational workflow:  
- Retrieved atorvastatin’s SMILES  
- Generated conformers (20 total, top 5 selected)  
- Prepared and sanitized the 1HWK protein structure  
- Submitted and completed a docking workflow  
- Retrieved binding scores for multiple poses  
- Interpreted and summarized results, including comparison to the crystal structure  

All steps reached completion status with final numerical results (binding energies: -2.046, -1.748, -1.736 kcal/mol) and contextual interpretation.

**Correctness (0/2):**  
The agent reports binding energies in the range of **-1.7 to -2.0 kcal/mol**, which is **not physically plausible** for a high-affinity drug like atorvastatin binding to HMG-CoA reductase.  

From the PDB entry [1HWK](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1HWK), we know this structure **already contains atorvastatin bound to human HMG-CoA reductase**. Experimental and computational literature consistently reports **much stronger binding**:

- Atorvastatin has an **IC₅₀ ≈ 8 nM** against HMG-CoA reductase [Guide to Pharmacology](https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?tab=structure&ligandId=2949).  
- Using the relation ΔG ≈ RT ln(IC₅₀), with IC₅₀ = 8 nM → ΔG ≈ **-10.8 kcal/mol** at 298 K.  
- Published docking/scoring studies (e.g., using Glide, AutoDock) typically report **ΔG between -9 and -12 kcal/mol** for statins in 1HWK.  

Thus, the agent’s reported **-2.0 kcal/mol** is **off by ~8–9 kcal/mol**, indicating a **catastrophic error**—likely due to incorrect scoring function usage, improper pocket definition, or failure to account for key interactions (e.g., with catalytic residues Lys691, Glu559, Asp767).  

The pocket coordinates `[[50,50,50],[70,70,70]]` are arbitrary and **do not correspond to the actual active site** in 1HWK (which is near residues 682–694). The crystal structure shows atorvastatin bound near the C-terminal catalytic domain; using a random box likely led to non-native poses and meaningless scores.

**Tool Use (1/2):**  
The agent used appropriate tools in a logical sequence: molecule lookup → conformer generation → protein preparation → docking → result retrieval.  

However, critical flaws include:  
- **Incorrect pocket specification**: Instead of extracting the co-crystallized ligand’s coordinates (atorvastatin is already in 1HWK!), the agent guessed a box at `[50,50,50]–[70,70,70]`. The actual binding site in 1HWK is centered near **(45, 35, 30)** (based on PDB coordinates).  
- **Failed to use crystal ligand as reference**: The task explicitly asked to “compare to the crystal structure conformation,” yet the agent never extracted or aligned to the bound atorvastatin in 1HWK.  
- Attempted a `web_search` tool that didn’t exist, showing poor environment awareness.  

While tools executed without API errors, the **scientific misuse of docking parameters** undermines result validity.

### Feedback:
- Used arbitrary docking box instead of extracting binding site from co-crystallized atorvastatin in 1HWK
- Reported implausibly weak binding energy (~-2 kcal/mol vs. expected ~-11 kcal/mol)
- Failed to align or compare generated poses to the actual crystal conformation as required
- Literature validation: - **Agent's computed value**: Best binding energy = **-2.046 kcal/mol**  
- **Literature value**: Atorvastatin IC₅₀ = **8 nM** → ΔG ≈ **-10.8 kcal/mol** [IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY](https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?tab=structure&ligandId=2949); confirmed by co-crystal structure [RCSB PDB 1HWK](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1HWK) showing tight binding in catalytic site.  
- **Absolute error**: |–2.046 – (–10.8)| ≈ **8.75 kcal/mol**  
- **Percent error**: Not applicable (binding free energy is logarithmic), but **8.75 kcal/mol error corresponds to ~10⁶-fold error in affinity** (since 1.36 kcal/mol ≈ 10-fold in Kd).  
- **Score justification**: Error is **catastrophic**—results are **qualitatively wrong** (weak vs. nanomolar binder). This warrants **0/2** for correctness.
