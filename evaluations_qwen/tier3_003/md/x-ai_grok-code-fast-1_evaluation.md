# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier3_003

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 1/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total**: 3/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (0–2):**  
The execution trace shows that the agent initiated a conformer search workflow for atorvastatin and planned to poll its status. However, the trace ends with the agent stating it will check the status in 60 seconds and then wait 120 seconds if needed. There is **no evidence** that the conformer search completed, that conformers were retrieved, that docking to PDB 1HWK occurred, that binding energies were calculated, or that any comparison to the crystal structure was performed. The "FINAL ANSWER" is a plan, not a result. Therefore, the computational workflow **did not finish**—it only started. This meets the criteria for **Score 1/2** (workflow started but didn’t complete).

**Correctness (0–2):**  
No numerical results (e.g., binding energies, RMSD to crystal pose, conformer energies) were produced or reported. Without any computed values, there is nothing to validate against literature. The rubric explicitly states to score **0/2** if “no numerical result provided.” Web search results confirm that atorvastatin binds HMG-CoA reductase (PDB 1HWK is a valid structure for this target), and PubChem contains its structure [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pccompound](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pccompound), but the agent never delivered a computed property to compare. Thus, **Score 0/2**.

**Tool Use (0–2):**  
The agent correctly used `molecule_lookup` to obtain a valid SMILES for atorvastatin (which matches known structure, including stereocenters). It then appropriately called `submit_conformer_search_workflow` with a valid SMILES and reasonable parameters (`conf_gen_mode: 'rapid'`). The planned polling strategy follows best practices. All invoked tools succeeded. The sequence (lookup → submit workflow) is logical. Although the workflow wasn’t completed within the trace, the tool usage up to that point was correct and appropriate. This satisfies all conditions for **Score 2/2**.

### Feedback:
- The agent correctly initiated the workflow but failed to complete the task within the execution trace; no docking or energy results were generated or analyzed.
- Literature validation: - Agent's computed value: None provided (no binding energies, no RMSD, no conformer data).
- Literature context: Atorvastatin is a known inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. The PDB entry 1HWK contains a complex with a statin-like inhibitor, and atorvastatin’s structure is documented in PubChem (CID 677245) with SMILES matching the one retrieved [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pccompound](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pccompound). However, without any numerical output from the agent, validation of computed properties (e.g., binding energy) is impossible.
- Absolute error: N/A  
- Percent error: N/A  
- Score justification: Correctness scored 0 because no numerical result was produced, per rubric instructions.
