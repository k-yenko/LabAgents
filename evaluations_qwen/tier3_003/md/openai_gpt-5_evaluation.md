# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier3_003

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 1/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 1/2
- **Total**: 2/6

### Reasoning:
**1. Completion (0–2):**  
The execution trace shows that the agent initiated all required steps: molecule lookup, conformer search, protein preparation, and five docking workflows. However, **none of the workflows actually completed**—all status checks returned "RUNNING", and the final answer contains **no numerical results** (no binding energies, no RMSD values, no conformer energies). The agent only outlined a plan and polling schedule but never retrieved final outputs. Therefore, the computational workflow **did not finish**, and no final result was presented. This matches the **Score 1/2** criteria ("Workflow started but didn't complete").

**2. Correctness (0–2):**  
Because **no numerical results were produced**, there is nothing to validate against literature. The agent never reported a binding energy, RMSD, or conformer energy. Per the rubric, this qualifies for **Score 0/2** ("No numerical result provided").

Web search confirms that RMSD-based comparison of docked ligands to crystal poses is standard practice, and tools like LigRMSD exist for this purpose [bioinformatics.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/9/2912/5700716?login=true). Additionally, docking to HMG-CoA reductase (1HWK) with atorvastatin is a well-established benchmark, and successful docking should yield poses with low RMSD (<2 Å) to the crystal ligand. But since the agent provided **no computed RMSD or energy**, correctness cannot be assessed positively.

**3. Tool Use (0–2):**  
The agent selected appropriate tools: `molecule_lookup`, `submit_conformer_search_workflow`, `create_protein_from_pdb_id`, `sanitize_protein`, and `submit_docking_workflow`. The SMILES for atorvastatin is correct. However, there were **significant inefficiencies and errors**:
- The agent attempted to use `pocket: 'auto'`, which failed, requiring a manual fallback.
- Instead of waiting for the conformer search to complete and docking the **top 5 explicit conformers** (as per the task), the agent submitted **five identical docking jobs** with `do_csearch=True`, which duplicates effort and does **not** fulfill the requirement to dock the top 5 pre-generated conformers.
- The pocket box `[[-50,-50,-50],[150,150,150]]` is excessively large (200 Å per side), far larger than the actual binding site in 1HWK (which is ~20–30 Å wide). This is inefficient and may reduce docking accuracy.

While tools executed successfully after correction, the **workflow design deviated from the task specification** (dock top 5 conformers → instead, ran 5 independent docking jobs with internal sampling). This constitutes a **logical flaw in tool orchestration**, warranting **Score 1/2**.

### Feedback:
- The agent failed to complete the workflow and never retrieved results; polling alone does not constitute completion.
- Docking five identical jobs with internal conformer search does not satisfy the requirement to dock the top 5 pre-generated conformers.
- The excessively large docking box and initial pocket format error show suboptimal tool use.
- Literature validation: - **Agent's computed value**: None provided (no binding energies, no RMSD).
- **Literature context**: Atorvastatin is the co-crystallized ligand in PDB 1HWK. Successful docking should reproduce its pose with RMSD < 2.0 Å. Tools like LigRMSD are designed for such comparisons [bioinformatics.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/9/2912/5700716?login=true). PubChem and prior studies confirm atorvastatin’s flexibility, with conformer RMSD accuracy dependent on rotatable bonds and ring systems [jcheminf.biomedcentral.com](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1758-2946-5-1).
- **Absolute/Percent error**: Not applicable — no result to compare.
- **Score justification**: Correctness scored 0 because the agent failed to produce any numerical output, violating a core requirement of the task.
