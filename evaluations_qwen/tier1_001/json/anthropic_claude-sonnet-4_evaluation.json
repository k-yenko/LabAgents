      "content": "Of particular note is a paper series from the Avdeef group, which discusses a wide variety of substance classes and use cases in great detail. (10,11) Moreover, various theoretical approaches exist to predict K OW values. (12\u221215) The most widely used tools are quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship (QSAR) and Xlog P 3. More recently, machine-learning algorithms are used for this purpose. (16\u221218) They rely on large data sets, whereas their outcome strongly depends on the reliability of the input data used as training sets. (19) Thus, there is significant interest in expanding the amount of available and, above all, reliable data."

Due to this confusion, some pKa data is misrepresented in data repositories, including the widely\u0002used and highly trusted ChEMBL Database. Such datasets are widely used to supply training data for pKa prediction models, and hence, confusion and errors in the data makes model performance worse. Herein, we discuss the intricacies of this issue. We make suggestions for describing acid-base phenomena, training pKa prediction models, and stewarding pKa datasets, given the high potential for confusion and potentially high impact of accurately describing acid-base phenomena."

      "content": "Collecting both microscopic and macroscopic p _K_ a predictions allowed in-depth evaluation of p _K_ a prediction performance. This article highlights deficiencies of typical p _K_ a prediction evaluation approaches when the distinction between microscopic and macroscopic p _K_ as is ignored; in particular, we suggest more stringent evaluation criteria for microscopic and macroscopic p _K_ a predictions guided by the available experimental data. Top-performing submissions for macroscopic p _K_ a predictions achieved RMSE of 0.7\u20131.0 p _K_ a units and included both quantum chemical and empirical approaches, where the total number of extra or missing macroscopic p _K_ as predicted by these submissions were fewer than 8 for 24 molecules."

      "title": "Overview of the SAMPL6 pKa Challenge: Evaluating small molecule microscopic and macroscopic pKa predictions",
      "content": "Underestimation of ligand p _K_ a by 1 unit can lead to errors in binding free energy errors up to 1.2 kcal/mol. The SAMPL6 p _K_ a Challenge demonstrated the need for improving p _K_ a prediction methods for drug-like molecules, especially for challenging moieties and multiprotic molecules. The acid dissociation constant ( _K_ a) describes the protonation state equilibrium of a molecule given pH. More commonly, we refer to _pK_ a = \u2212log10 **_K_** _a\u2032_, its negative logarithmic form. Predicting p _K_ a is a prerequisite for predicting many other properties of small molecules such as their protein binding affinity, distribution coefficient (log _D_), membrane permeability, and solubility."

      "content": " Abstract Partition coefficients describe the equilibrium partitioning of a single, defined charge state of a solute between two liquid phases in contact, typically a neutral solute. Octanol\u2013water partition coefficients (\\(K_{\\rm ow}\\)), or their logarithms (log\u00a0 P), are frequently used as a measure of lipophilicity in drug discovery. The partition coefficient is a physicochemical property that captures the thermodynamics of relative solvation between aqueous and nonpolar phases, and therefore provides an excellent test for physics-based computational models that predict properties of pharmaceutical relevance such as protein-ligand binding affinities or hydration/solvation free energies."
