      "content": "Compared to the SAMPL6 p _K_ a challenge, accuracy remains unchanged in SAMPL7. Interestingly, here, though macroscopic p _K_ a values were often predicted with reasonable accuracy, there was dramatically more disagreement among participants as to which microscopic transitions produced these values (with methods often disagreeing even as to the sign of the free energy change associated with certain transitions), indicating far more work needs to be done on p _K_ a prediction methods. ### [LogP prediction performance with the SMD solvation model and the M06 density functional family for SAMPL6 blind prediction challenge molecules](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10822-020-00278-1?fromPaywallRec=false)"

      "content": "Underestimation of ligand p _K_ a by 1 unit can lead to errors in binding free energy errors up to 1.2 kcal/mol. The SAMPL6 p _K_ a Challenge demonstrated the need for improving p _K_ a prediction methods for drug-like molecules, especially for challenging moieties and multiprotic molecules. The acid dissociation constant ( _K_ a) describes the protonation state equilibrium of a molecule given pH. More commonly, we refer to _pK_ a = \u2212log10 **_K_** _a\u2032_, its negative logarithmic form. Predicting p _K_ a is a prerequisite for predicting many other properties of small molecules such as their protein binding affinity, distribution coefficient (log _D_), membrane permeability, and solubility."

      "content": "Collecting both microscopic and macroscopic p _K_ a predictions allowed in-depth evaluation of p _K_ a prediction performance. This article highlights deficiencies of typical p _K_ a prediction evaluation approaches when the distinction between microscopic and macroscopic p _K_ as is ignored; in particular, we suggest more stringent evaluation criteria for microscopic and macroscopic p _K_ a predictions guided by the available experimental data. Top-performing submissions for macroscopic p _K_ a predictions achieved RMSE of 0.7\u20131.0 p _K_ a units and included both quantum chemical and empirical approaches, where the total number of extra or missing macroscopic p _K_ as predicted by these submissions were fewer than 8 for 24 molecules."

      "content": "Within the scope of SAMPL7 challenge for predicting physical properties, the Integral Equation Formalism of the Miertus-Scrocco-Tomasi (IEFPCM/MST) continuum solvation model has been used for the blind prediction of _n_-octanol/water partition coefficients and acidity constants of a set of 22 and 20 sulfonamide-containing compounds, respectively. The log _P_ and p _K_ a were computed using the B3LPYP/6-31G(d) parametrized version of the IEFPCM/MST model. The performance of our method for partition coefficients yielded a root-mean square error of 1.03 (log _P_ units), placing this method among the most accurate theoretical approaches in the comparison with both globally (rank 8th) and physical (rank 2nd) methods."
