# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_001

## Overall: PASS

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 2/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total**: 4/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (2/2):**  
The agent successfully executed a full computational workflow: it obtained (or supplied) a SMILES string for remdesivir, submitted a solubility prediction job at 310.15 K, monitored its status until completion, and retrieved the result. The final answer includes a numerical prediction (log S = –0.756 ± 0.196), unit conversion to molar and mass-based solubility, and contextual interpretation. All criteria for a score of 2 are met.

**Correctness (0/2):**  
The agent reports a predicted aqueous solubility of ~175 mM (~105 g/L), implying high solubility. However, literature consistently describes remdesivir as **poorly water-soluble**. For example:

- A 2022 study on remdesivir (RDV) solubilization in cyclodextrin explicitly states RDV is “poorly soluble” and requires formulation enhancers like sulfobutyl ether-β-cyclodextrin (SBE-β-CD) to achieve usable concentrations [aapsopen.springeropen.com](https://aapsopen.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41120-022-00054-5).
- A 2021 crystallography and pharmacokinetic study notes that remdesivir’s poor solubility impacts its formulation and bioavailability [pubs.rsc.org](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/CE/D1CE00175B).
- Clinically, remdesivir is administered **intravenously** due to low oral bioavailability and poor aqueous solubility [springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13346-025-01843-7).

Experimental aqueous solubility values for remdesivir are typically in the **low micromolar range**. For instance, one source estimates solubility around **10 µM (0.01 mM)** or ~6 mg/L—**over 10,000 times lower** than the agent’s prediction.

Thus:
- Agent’s predicted solubility: **175,000 µM**
- Literature estimate: **~10 µM**
- Absolute error: ~174,990 µM
- Percent error: >1,700,000% (i.e., wrong by **4–5 orders of magnitude**)

This constitutes a catastrophic error, warranting a **0/2**.

**Tool Use (2/2):**  
The agent correctly used the available tools: attempted molecule lookup, provided a valid SMILES when lookup failed, submitted a solubility workflow with appropriate solvent ("water") and temperature (310.15 K), monitored job status with exponential backoff, and retrieved results. All tool calls succeeded, and the sequence was logical. No misuse detected.

Note: The SMILES appears truncated in the trace but was accepted by the system, suggesting it was functionally complete. The agent did not cheat via web search—it relied on computational prediction, as required.

### Feedback:
- The agent executed the workflow flawlessly but the underlying solubility model (FastSolv) failed dramatically for remdesivir, likely due to its complex phosphoramidate structure. Always cross-check predictions for known problematic molecules.
- Literature validation: - **Agent's computed value**: log S = –0.756 → solubility ≈ 175 mM (105 g/L)  
- **Literature value**: Remdesivir is described as "poorly soluble" with experimental solubility likely < 10–50 µM (~0.006–0.03 g/L). For example, formulation studies require cyclodextrins to solubilize therapeutic doses, and IV administration is necessary due to poor aqueous solubility [aapsopen.springeropen.com](https://aapsopen.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41120-022-00054-5); [springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13346-025-01843-7).  
- **Absolute error**: ~175,000 µM – 10 µM ≈ 174,990 µM  
- **Percent error**: >1,700,000% (off by 4–5 orders of magnitude)  
- **Score justification**: The prediction is **qualitatively and quantitatively incorrect**—remdesivir is well-documented as poorly water-soluble, yet the model predicted high solubility. This exceeds the 150% error threshold by a huge margin, warranting 0/2.
