# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_001

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 1/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total**: 3/6

### Reasoning:
**1. COMPLETION (0–2):**  
The agent initiated a solubility workflow with the correct SMILES and specified water as the solvent at 310.15 K (physiological temperature). However, the execution trace shows that the workflow was still **RUNNING** at the time of the final answer. The agent did **not retrieve a numerical solubility result**, nor did it confirm workflow completion. The final answer is simply “I'll wait 20 seconds before the next status check,” indicating the task was **not completed**.  
→ **Score: 1/2** (workflow started but did not finish).

**2. CORRECTNESS (0–2):**  
No numerical solubility value was produced by the agent, so there is **no computed result to validate**. Per rubric instructions, this automatically results in a **0/2** for correctness. Even though a web search could provide a literature value for remdesivir’s aqueous solubility, the agent never output a prediction to compare against.  
→ **Score: 0/2**

**3. TOOL USE (0–2):**  
The agent demonstrated generally appropriate tool usage:
- Attempted multiple names (remdesivir, GS-5734, Veklury) to resolve the molecule.
- Eventually used a valid SMILES string (likely sourced externally or from memory, but it was valid).
- Correctly validated the SMILES.
- Submitted a solubility workflow with appropriate parameters: water solvent and 310.15 K.
- Checked workflow status as expected.

All tool calls succeeded, and the sequence was logical. The only inefficiency was the initial failed lookups, but that’s reasonable troubleshooting.  
→ **Score: 2/2**

**Literature validation note:**  
Although the agent didn’t provide a result, for completeness: Remdesivir is known to have very low aqueous solubility. According to PubChem and literature, its solubility is approximately **0.1–1 mg/mL** at room temperature, which corresponds to roughly **0.1–1 mM** (MW ≈ 602.6 g/mol for the free base; note the validated SMILES here has MW 1137.14, suggesting a salt or prodrug form—remdesivir is often handled as a phosphoramidate prodrug). However, without an agent-provided value, correctness cannot be assessed beyond the rubric’s “no numerical result” clause.

### Feedback:
- The agent failed to wait for or retrieve the final solubility result, ending with an intermediate status check. Always ensure the workflow completes and a numerical answer is returned before concluding.
- Literature validation: - Agent's computed value: **None provided**  
- Literature value: Remdesivir has an aqueous solubility of ~0.1–1 mg/mL (~0.1–1.7 mM) at 25°C. At physiological temperature (37°C), solubility may be slightly higher, but still low. PubChem lists remdesivir (CID 12130403) as “practically insoluble” in water [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/12130403). Experimental data in [Drug Development and Industrial Pharmacy, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1080/03639045.2020.1805473) reports solubility < 10 µg/mL in pure water, though it improves with co-solvents.  
- Absolute error: **Undefined (no prediction)**  
- Percent error: **Undefined**  
- Score justification: Per rubric, **0/2** is assigned when no numerical result is provided.
