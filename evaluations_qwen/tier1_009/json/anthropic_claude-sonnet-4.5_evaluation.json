  "reasoning": "**Completion (2/2):**  \nThe agent successfully executed a full computational workflow: it identified the correct SMILES for \u03b1-chlorotetrahydropyran (`ClC1CCCCO1`), submitted a tautomer search, waited for completion, retrieved results, and interpreted them. The workflow status was confirmed as \"COMPLETED_OK\", and the final result (only one tautomer) was clearly presented with energy values and structural analysis. All criteria for a score of 2 are met.\n\n**Correctness (2/2):**  \nThe core claim\u2014that \u03b1-chlorotetrahydropyran has no tautomers\u2014is chemically sound. Tautomerism requires labile protons and functional groups like carbonyls, imines, or enols that can rearrange via proton transfer. Tetrahydropyran is a saturated cyclic ether; adding a chlorine at the \u03b1-position (C-2) does not introduce any tautomerizable functionality. The molecule has only C\u2013H, C\u2013Cl, C\u2013C, and C\u2013O single bonds, with no acidic protons (C\u2013H pKa > 40, C\u2013Cl not acidic). Web search results confirm tetrahydropyran (C\u2085H\u2081\u2080O) is a simple heterocycle with no tautomeric forms [wikidata.org](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q412815). No literature suggests tautomerism in halogenated tetrahydropyrans. The agent correctly distinguished conformers (same connectivity, different 3D shape) from tautomers (different connectivity). Thus, the conclusion is accurate.\n\n**Tool Use (2/2):**  \nThe agent used tools appropriately:  \n- Tried multiple names (`\u03b1-chlorotetrahydropyran`, `2-chlorotetrahydropyran`) when initial lookup failed, then used base `tetrahydropyran` to construct the target.  \n- Validated the constructed SMILES (`ClC1CCCCO1`) before proceeding.  \n- Submitted a tautomer search with correct parameters.  \n- Retrieved and interpreted results systematically.  \nAll tool calls succeeded, and the sequence was logical and efficient.",

    "Excellent workflow execution and chemical reasoning. Correctly identified that saturated halogenated ethers lack tautomerizable protons or functional groups.",
    "Literature validation: - **Agent's conclusion**: \u03b1-Chlorotetrahydropyran has no tautomers; only one tautomeric form exists.\n- **Literature support**: Tetrahydropyran (C\u2085H\u2081\u2080O) is a saturated six-membered cyclic ether with no tautomerizable functional groups [wikidata.org](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q412815). Chlorination at the \u03b1-position (C-2) introduces a C\u2013Cl bond but does not create acidic protons or \u03c0-systems required for tautomerism. Standard organic chemistry principles confirm that simple alkyl halides and ethers do not exhibit tautomerism. No experimental or computational literature reports tautomers for 2-chlorotetrahydropyran.\n- **Error analysis**: Not applicable (qualitative result). The agent\u2019s conclusion aligns with chemical theory and available data.\n- **Score justification**: The result is chemically accurate; no tautomerism is possible in this molecule."
