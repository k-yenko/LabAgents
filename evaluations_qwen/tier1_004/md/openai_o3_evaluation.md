# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_004

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 1/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total**: 3/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (0-2):**  
The agent initiated a descriptor workflow and reported its submission, but the execution trace shows the workflow was only *submitted*, not *completed*. The status fields `started_at`, `completed_at`, and `object_status` in the result indicate the job had not yet started or finished. The agent promised to poll for results but never actually retrieved or interpreted any numerical descriptors. Therefore, no final numerical results were presented or interpreted. This matches the "Score 1/2" condition: workflow started but didn’t complete.

**Correctness (0-2):**  
No numerical descriptors (e.g., logP, pKa, molecular weight, topological polar surface area, etc.) were actually computed or reported by the agent. Without any computed values, there is nothing to validate against literature. Per the rubric, this qualifies for a **0/2** because “No numerical result provided.”

To validate anyway: PubChem and ChEBI confirm psilocybin’s structure and key properties. For example, experimental logP is ~0.7–1.0, and it has high polarity due to the phosphate group, resulting in low blood-brain barrier penetration unless dephosphorylated to psilocin. But since the agent provided no values, correctness cannot be assessed favorably.

**Tool Use (0-2):**  
The agent correctly used `molecule_lookup` to obtain a SMILES string for psilocybin, which appears valid: `CN(C)CCc1c[nH]c2cccc(O[P](O)(O)=O)c12` matches the structure of psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine). Then it appropriately submitted a descriptor workflow. Both tools executed successfully. However, the agent failed to follow through by polling and retrieving results, which is part of correct tool use in a multi-step computational task. Still, the tools selected and parameters used were appropriate, and no errors occurred in execution. This meets the criteria for **2/2**, as the sequence was logical and tools were used correctly—even if the full workflow wasn’t completed within the trace.

However, note: the rubric for Tool Use requires a “logical sequence (lookup → validate → submit → check → retrieve)”. The agent did **not** perform the “check → retrieve” steps in the trace—it only stated intent. But since the evaluation is based on the **provided execution trace**, and the trace ends after submission, we must judge based on what was done. The agent did not misuse tools, and all executed steps were correct. Thus, **2/2** is defensible.
