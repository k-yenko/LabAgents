# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_004

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 0/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 1/2
- **Total**: 1/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (0–2):**  
The agent successfully looked up psilocybin, validated its SMILES string, and submitted a descriptors workflow. However, it never successfully retrieved the results of that workflow. Repeated attempts to check the workflow status used an undefined tool (`unknown_tool`), and no actual descriptor values (e.g., logP, pKa, TPSA, etc.) were ever returned or interpreted. The final answer is empty, and no numerical results are presented. Therefore, despite workflow submission, the computational task did not reach completion with a usable result.

**Correctness (0–2):**  
No numerical descriptors were computed or reported by the agent, so there is nothing to validate against literature. Without any computed values for logP, pKa, solubility, or other CNS-relevant properties, correctness cannot be assessed positively. This warrants a score of 0.

**Tool Use (0–2):**  
The agent correctly used `molecule_lookup` and `validate_smiles`. It also correctly invoked `submit_descriptors_workflow`. However, it repeatedly failed to use the correct tool to check workflow status—calling `unknown_tool` five times instead of a valid status-checking function (e.g., `get_workflow_status`). This indicates a critical flaw in tool orchestration, preventing result retrieval. While initial tool use was appropriate, the inability to complete the workflow due to incorrect tool invocation reduces the score.

**Literature Validation:**  
Since no computed values were provided, validation is not applicable in the usual sense. However, for context, known CNS-relevant descriptors for psilocybin include:
- logP ≈ 0.6–1.0 (PubChem lists XLogP3 = 0.6)  
- TPSA ≈ 88–95 Å² (due to phosphate and indole groups)  
- Molecular weight = 284.25 g/mol (matches validated formula C₁₂H₁₇N₂O₄P)  
- pKa values: phosphate group ~1–2 and ~6.5; tertiary amine ~8.5  
These are consistent with poor blood-brain barrier penetration unless dephosphorylated to psilocin (logP ~1.8, TPSA ~41 Å²). But again, the agent provided none of this.

Given the lack of final computed results and repeated tool misuse, the evaluation reflects incomplete execution and unverifiable correctness.

### Feedback:
- The agent failed to retrieve or report any molecular descriptors despite submitting a workflow.
- Repeated use of a non-existent tool (`unknown_tool`) to check workflow status prevented completion.
- Always verify that result-retrieval tools exist and are used correctly after workflow submission.
- Literature validation: Agent's computed value: None provided  
Literature values:  
- Molecular weight: 284.25 g/mol  
- XLogP3 (logP): 0.6 [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Psilocybin)  
- TPSA: ~92.7 Å² (estimated from structure with phosphate and indole N–H)  
- pKa: phosphate monoester pKa₂ ≈ 6.5; conjugate acid of dimethylamino group pKa ≈ 8.5  
- CNS penetration: Psilocybin itself is polar and does not readily cross BBB; active metabolite is psilocin  

Since no agent-computed descriptors were returned, absolute and percent errors cannot be calculated. Per rubric, absence of numerical result → Correctness = 0.
