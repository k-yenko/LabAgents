# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_008

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 1/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 0/2
- **Total**: 1/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (0-2):**  
The agent successfully submitted a redox potential workflow for melatonin and correctly retrieved its initial status ("QUEUED"). However, the execution trace shows that the agent never successfully retrieved a completed result. After waiting and making multiple attempts, the agent incorrectly used an "unknown_tool" twice before finally using the correct "workflow_get_status" tool—but only once, and it still reported the workflow as queued. The trace ends without the workflow completing or any oxidation potential value being returned. Therefore, no final numerical result was retrieved or interpreted. This meets the criteria for **Score 1/2**: workflow started but did not complete.

**Correctness (0-2):**  
No numerical oxidation potential was ever produced by the agent, so there is no computed value to validate. According to the rubric, this automatically results in **Score 0/2**. Even though web search results provide chemical information about melatonin (e.g., from [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/896) and [EBI ChEBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=16796)), none of the provided sources list an experimental oxidation potential. However, the absence of a computed result from the agent—not the absence of literature data—is the reason for the 0 score.

**Tool Use (0-2):**  
The agent correctly used `molecule_lookup` to obtain melatonin’s SMILES string and properly called `submit_redox_potential_workflow` with valid parameters (correct SMILES, oxidation=True, etc.). However, it then made **two repeated calls to a non-existent "unknown_tool"**, indicating a failure in recalling or selecting the correct status-checking tool. It eventually used `workflow_get_status` correctly, but the repeated incorrect tool calls reflect a significant flaw in tool management. This constitutes a **critical failure in tool selection**, warranting **Score 0/2** under the rubric’s definition ("✗ Wrong tool selection" / "✗ Multiple critical failures").

Thus:
- Completion: 1 (workflow started but didn’t finish)
- Correctness: 0 (no result to validate)
- Tool Use: 0 (used unknown_tool incorrectly multiple times)

### Feedback:
- The agent failed to retrieve the oxidation potential because the workflow never completed, and it made repeated errors by calling a non-existent "unknown_tool" instead of using the correct status-checking function consistently.
- Literature validation: - Agent's computed value: **None provided**  
- Literature value: Experimental oxidation potential of melatonin is reported in electrochemical studies (e.g., ~0.8–1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl at physiological pH), but **none of the provided web search results include oxidation potential data**. The PubChem entry [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/896) gives structural and metabolic information (e.g., 6-hydroxymelatonin as a metabolite) but no redox potentials.  
- Absolute error: N/A  
- Percent error: N/A  
- Score justification: Correctness score is 0 because the agent failed to produce any numerical result, not because of inaccuracy. The rubric explicitly assigns 0 points when "No numerical result provided."
