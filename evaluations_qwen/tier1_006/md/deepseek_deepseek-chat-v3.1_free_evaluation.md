# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_006

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 1/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 1/2
- **Total**: 2/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (0-2):**  
The agent successfully looked up and validated the SMILES for ketamine and submitted a solubility workflow using `submit_solubility_workflow`. However, the execution trace shows that the agent attempted to check the workflow status using an `unknown_tool` (twice), which is not a valid function. There is no evidence that the agent successfully retrieved the result of the solubility prediction. The final answer is empty, and no numerical solubility value is presented. Therefore, the workflow was initiated but never completed or interpreted.

→ **Score: 1/2**

**Correctness (0-2):**  
Because no numerical result was provided by the agent, correctness cannot be assessed against literature. However, even if we assume the agent intended to compute it, the lack of a final value means this dimension fails by default per rubric: “No numerical result provided” → **Score: 0/2**

Nonetheless, for completeness, I searched for experimental solubility of ketamine in ethanol. PubChem and literature indicate that ketamine is highly soluble in ethanol—often described as "freely soluble" or miscible in practical pharmaceutical contexts. Quantitatively, one source reports solubility of ketamine hydrochloride in ethanol as ~50 mg/mL (though freebase data is scarcer). However, without an agent-provided value, comparison is impossible.

**Tool Use (0-2):**  
The agent correctly used `molecule_lookup` and `validate_smiles` with valid inputs. It then properly called `submit_solubility_workflow` with correct SMILES, solvent (as "ethanol", which was internally mapped to "CCO"), and temperature (298.15 K). However, the agent failed to use the correct tool to retrieve workflow results—instead calling `unknown_tool` twice, which does not exist. This indicates a breakdown in the tool-use protocol during the retrieval phase.

→ Appropriate tools were selected initially, but the agent did not complete the logical sequence (submit → check → retrieve) due to using a non-existent tool.

→ **Score: 1/2**

### Feedback:
- The agent correctly initiated the solubility prediction workflow but failed to retrieve or report the result, leaving the task incomplete. It also used a non-existent tool (`unknown_tool`) to check workflow status, breaking the execution chain. Always ensure the full tool sequence (including result retrieval) is implemented with valid function names.
- Literature validation: - Agent's computed value: **Not provided**  
- Literature value: Ketamine freebase is highly soluble in ethanol; ketamine HCl has solubility of approximately 50 mg/mL in ethanol at room temperature [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ketamine). Some pharmaceutical references describe it as "freely soluble" or "soluble in ethanol in all proportions" for formulation purposes.  
- Absolute error: **Undefined (no agent value)**  
- Percent error: **Undefined**  
- Score justification: Correctness scored 0 because the agent failed to output any numerical solubility value, which is required per rubric ("No numerical result provided").
