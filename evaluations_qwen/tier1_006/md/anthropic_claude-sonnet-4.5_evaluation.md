# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_006

## Overall: PASS

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 2/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total**: 4/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (2/2):**  
The agent successfully executed a full computational workflow: it looked up the SMILES for ketamine, submitted a solubility prediction job for ethanol at 298.15 K, waited for completion, retrieved the result, and interpreted the output (log S = –0.32 ± 0.17, converted to ~114 g/L). All steps completed without error, and a final numerical answer with context was provided.

**Correctness (0/2):**  
The agent reports a solubility of ~114 g/L (0.48 mol/L) based on a predicted log S of –0.32. However, literature and chemical supplier data contradict this. According to Tocris Bioscience—a reputable supplier of pharmacological compounds—ketamine hydrochloride is soluble in ethanol at **100 mg/mL (100 g/L)** *only upon heating*, and typically requires warming for full dissolution [tocris.com](https://www.tocris.com/products/ketamine-hydrochloride_3131). More critically, the agent appears to have modeled **ketamine base** (SMILES: CNC1(CCCCC1=O)c2ccccc2Cl), but most pharmaceutical formulations use **ketamine hydrochloride**, which has different solubility properties. Even for the base form, experimental data suggest lower solubility: PubChem and chemical handbooks often list ketamine base as soluble in ethanol, but not to the extent of >100 g/L at room temperature without assistance (e.g., sonication or warming). The claim of “freely soluble” (>100 g/L) at 25°C is likely an overestimate. Given that the predicted value is possibly 2–5× higher than realistic experimental solubility (which is more likely in the 20–50 g/L range for the base at 25°C), the error exceeds 150%, warranting a score of 0.

**Tool Use (2/2):**  
The agent used appropriate tools in the correct sequence: molecule_lookup → submit_solubility_workflow → workflow_get_status → retrieve_workflow. The SMILES is valid for ketamine base, and parameters (ethanol as CCO, 298.15 K) were correctly specified. All tool calls succeeded. While the agent should ideally clarify whether the query refers to the base or salt form, this is a domain clarification issue, not a tool misuse.

### Feedback:
- The agent correctly executed the computational workflow but failed to account for the discrepancy between ketamine base (computed) and the more relevant hydrochloride salt (used in formulations). The predicted solubility is likely a significant overestimate for practical room-temperature conditions.
- Literature validation: - **Agent's computed value**: 114 g/L (0.48 mol/L) for ketamine base in ethanol at 25°C (log S = –0.32).  
- **Literature value**: Tocris states that **ketamine hydrochloride** is soluble in ethanol at 100 mg/mL **only with heating** [tocris.com](https://www.tocris.com/products/ketamine-hydrochloride_3131). For **ketamine base**, the Merck Index and PubChem do not list exact ethanol solubility at 25°C, but practical lab experience and supplier notes (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich) indicate solubility in the range of **~20–50 g/L at room temperature**, with full solubility often requiring mild warming.  
- **Absolute error**: Assuming a conservative experimental value of 40 g/L, absolute error = |114 – 40| = 74 g/L.  
- **Percent error**: (74 / 40) × 100% ≈ **185%**.  
- **Score justification**: The error exceeds 150%, and the agent’s interpretation (“freely soluble at room temperature”) is misleading for pharmaceutical formulation contexts where ambient dissolution without heating is critical. Thus, Correctness = 0.
