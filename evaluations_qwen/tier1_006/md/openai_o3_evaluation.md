# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_006

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 1/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total**: 3/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (0–2):**  
The agent submitted a solubility workflow but did **not** retrieve or present a final numerical result. The final answer only states that the workflow was submitted and that the agent will check its status later. According to the execution trace, the workflow status remains "not completed" (started_at and completed_at are null). Therefore, the computational task did **not finish**, and no solubility value was produced. This meets the criteria for **Score 1/2**: workflow started but didn’t complete.

**Correctness (0–2):**  
No numerical solubility value was provided by the agent, so there is nothing to validate against literature. Per the rubric, this automatically qualifies for **Score 0/2** under correctness (“No numerical result provided”).

However, for completeness, I performed a web search to determine if experimental solubility data for ketamine in ethanol is available. The PubChem entries for ketamine and ketamine hydrochloride ([pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3821), [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ketamine%20hydrochloride)) provide extensive chemical and pharmacological data but **do not list quantitative solubility in ethanol**. General pharmaceutical literature indicates ketamine free base is soluble in ethanol, but precise values (e.g., in mg/mL or mol/L at 298 K) are not readily available in public sources. Nevertheless, since the agent provided **no computed value**, correctness cannot be assessed favorably.

**Tool Use (0–2):**  
The agent correctly used `molecule_lookup` to obtain a valid SMILES for ketamine (`CNC1(CCCCC1=O)c2ccccc2Cl`), which matches the canonical structure of ketamine (2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(methylamino)cyclohexan-1-one) as listed in PubChem [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3821). It then appropriately called `submit_solubility_workflow` with correct solvent ("ethanol" mapped to "CCO"), temperature (298.15 K), and valid SMILES. All tool calls succeeded. The only issue is that the agent **did not proceed to poll or retrieve results**, but the rubric for Tool Use focuses on **correct usage**, not full task completion. Since tools were selected and parameterized correctly and executed successfully, this earns **Score 2/2**.

### Feedback:
- The agent correctly initiated the solubility prediction workflow but failed to complete the task by retrieving and reporting a result. For a pass, the agent must return a numerical solubility value, not just submit a job.
- Literature validation: - Agent's computed value: **None provided**  
- Literature value: Experimental solubility of ketamine (free base) in ethanol is **not quantitatively reported** in publicly accessible sources such as PubChem [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3821) or [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ketamine%20hydrochloride). While ketamine is known to be soluble in ethanol for pharmaceutical use, no precise numerical value (e.g., g/L or mol/L at 298 K) is available in the cited sources.  
- Absolute error: **Undefined** (no agent value)  
- Percent error: **Undefined**  
- Score justification: Correctness score is 0 because the agent failed to produce any numerical result, which is a rubric-defined failure condition regardless of literature availability.
