# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_006

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 0/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 1/2
- **Total**: 1/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (0-2):**  
The agent initiated a solubility workflow correctly but did **not** retrieve or present any numerical result. The final answer states only: "I'll check the status of the solubility workflow in 10 seconds," which indicates the workflow was submitted but **not completed or evaluated** within the trace. No result was fetched or interpreted. Therefore, this scores **0/2**, not 1 or 2, because the task requires a final solubility value for pharmaceutical formulation, and none was provided.

**Correctness (0-2):**  
Since **no numerical result** was returned by the agent, correctness cannot be assessed against literature. Per rubric instructions, this automatically scores **0/2**. Even though web search results do not directly list ketamine’s solubility in ethanol, the absence of any computed value from the agent disqualifies it from partial credit.

**Tool Use (0-2):**  
The agent correctly used `molecule_lookup` to obtain ketamine’s SMILES and then submitted a valid `submit_solubility_workflow` with appropriate parameters (ethanol as solvent, 298.15 K). Both tools executed successfully. However, the agent **failed to follow through** by not calling a status-check or result-retrieval tool after waiting. The workflow was left incomplete. Despite this, the tools used were appropriate and correctly parameterized. The rubric awards **2/2** only if the full logical sequence is followed (lookup → submit → check → retrieve). Since retrieval was omitted, this is a **critical omission** in a computational task requiring a final answer. Thus, this scores **1/2**—correct tools and parameters, but incomplete execution sequence.

However, upon closer reading of the Tool Use rubric: “Logical sequence (lookup → validate → submit → check → retrieve)” is required for 2/2. The agent **planned** to check but never actually **retrieved** the result. Since the trace ends with only a statement of intent and no actual retrieval tool call, the sequence is broken. This is more than a minor issue—it’s a failure to complete the task loop. But because the tools that *were* called worked correctly and were appropriate, and the error is one of **incompleteness rather than misuse**, 1/2 is justified.

### Feedback:
- The agent correctly initiated the solubility workflow but failed to retrieve or report any result, rendering the task incomplete. Always ensure computational workflows are not only submitted but also monitored to completion and their outputs extracted and interpreted.
- Literature validation: - **Agent's computed value**: None provided.  
- **Literature value**: Publicly available experimental solubility of ketamine in ethanol is not directly reported in the provided search results. However, ketamine hydrochloride is highly soluble in water and ethanol, and freebase ketamine is also known to be freely soluble in ethanol—typically cited as >50 mg/mL in pharmaceutical references (e.g., Martindale, PubChem). PubChem lists ketamine as "soluble in ethanol" but does not give a quantitative value at 298 K [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]. None of the provided search results ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03105-6), [github.com](https://github.com/aainonen/SolubilityAnalysis), etc.) contain ketamine-specific ethanol solubility data.  
- **Absolute error**: Undefined (no agent value).  
- **Percent error**: Undefined.  
- **Score justification**: Correctness score is 0 because the agent failed to produce any numerical result, which is a hard requirement per the rubric (“No numerical result provided” → 0/2).
