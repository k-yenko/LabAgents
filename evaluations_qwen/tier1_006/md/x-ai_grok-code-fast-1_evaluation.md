# LLM Judge Evaluation: tier1_006

## Overall: FAIL

### Scores:
- **Completion**: 1/2
- **Correctness**: 0/2
- **Tool Use**: 2/2
- **Total**: 3/6

### Reasoning:
**Completion (0–2):**  
The agent initiated a solubility workflow using `submit_solubility_workflow`, which returned a job UUID and indicated the job was created successfully. However, the execution trace shows the agent only *submitted* the job and planned to check its status after 10 seconds—but no subsequent step actually retrieved the result. The final answer merely states that the calculation was submitted and a check would occur, with no numerical solubility value returned. Therefore, the workflow did **not complete** in the sense of producing a final result. This matches the rubric’s “Score 1/2” condition: workflow started but didn’t complete.

**Correctness (0–2):**  
No numerical solubility value was provided by the agent, so there is nothing to validate against literature. According to the rubric, this automatically warrants a **0/2** for correctness. Even though a web search was performed, no experimental or predicted solubility value for ketamine in ethanol was found in the provided search results. The search results include a ChEMBL entry for ketamine [ebi.ac.uk](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/explore/compound/CHEMBL742), but it doesn’t list solubility in ethanol. Other results relate to ML solubility prediction repositories or unrelated compounds (e.g., tamoxifen). Thus, even if the agent had returned a value, validation would be challenging—but the core issue is the absence of any computed result.

**Tool Use (0–2):**  
The agent correctly used `molecule_lookup` to obtain the SMILES for ketamine, which is valid: `CNC1(CCCCC1=O)c2ccccc2Cl` matches ketamine’s structure. It then correctly formatted the solvent as ethanol (`CCO`) and temperature as 298.15 K, and submitted a valid solubility workflow. All tool calls succeeded. However, the agent failed to **retrieve** the result after submission, breaking the expected logical sequence (lookup → submit → check → retrieve → interpret). This is a notable omission in workflow execution. Still, the tools used were appropriate and parameters correct, so this qualifies for **2/2** under the rubric, which emphasizes correct selection and successful execution—not necessarily full end-to-end result delivery (which is covered under Completion).

### Feedback:
- The agent correctly initiated the solubility workflow but failed to retrieve and report the result, leaving the task incomplete. Always ensure the final answer includes the computed value, not just a status update.
- Literature validation: - Agent's computed value: **None provided**  
- Literature value: No experimental solubility value for ketamine in ethanol was found in the provided search results. The ChEMBL entry for ketamine ([ebi.ac.uk](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/explore/compound/CHEMBL742)) does not list ethanol solubility. Other sources in the search results discuss ML models for solubility prediction ([github.com/parthajitp/OpenChem-Implementation-for-Prediction-Solubility](https://github.com/parthajitp/OpenChem-Implementation-for-Prediction-Solubility); [github.com/yangha7/MoleculeSolubility](https://github.com/yangha7/MoleculeSolubility)) or unrelated compounds.  
- Absolute error: N/A  
- Percent error: N/A  
- Score justification: Correctness scored 0 because no numerical result was returned. Per rubric: “No numerical result provided” → 0/2.
