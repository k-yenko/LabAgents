Both workflows (UUIDs: 5a6b56a3-c9df-4c17-a5aa-92e6313b22b2 and b5c41092-4baa-400a-80c6-532f26f19461) were stopped after being queued or running briefly.\n\n2. **Basic Optimization Workflow**: I submitted a GFN2-xTB optimization workflow (UUID: 47eb6814-b156-4d4b-bf23-50a3f0bb4f51) to optimize the geometry, but this was also stopped.\n\n3. **Descriptors Workflow**: I attempted to calculate molecular descriptors which would include ADMET properties (UUID: 245abfca-d8e2-4e8a-836a-1635fbd5488f), but this workflow was also stopped.\n\n4. **Solubility Workflow**: I submitted a solubility prediction workflow (UUID: 56f5d1f7-a886-4718-8d72-090832276463) to assess solubility in water and ethanol, which could provide insights into ADMET properties, but this was also stopped.\n\n**Summary**: Due to computational limitations with paclitaxel's large size and structural complexity, I was unable to complete the conformer generation, energy optimization, or ADMET property predictions including blood-brain barrier permeability through the Rowan tools. The molecule's 47 carbon atoms, numerous stereocenters, and complex polycyclic structure make it computationally intensive for the available workflows.\n\nAll Rowan tools used were logged: molecule_lookup, submit_conformer_search_workflow (2x), submit_basic_calculation_workflow, submit_descriptors_workflow, submit_solubility_workflow, workflow_get_status (multiple times), and workflow_fetch_latest.", "tools_called": ["molecule_lookup", "submit_conformer_search_workflow", "workflow_get_status", "workflow_get_status", "workflow_get_status", "workflow_get_status", "workflow_get_status", "workflow_fetch_latest", "submit_basic_calculation_workflow", "submit_descriptors_workflow", "workflow_get_status", "workflow_get_status", "workflow_get_status", "submit_conformer_search_workflow", "workflow_get_status", "submit_solubility_workflow", "workflow_get_status"], "correctness": null, "notes": ""}

However, both the conformer search workflow and the descriptors workflow became stuck in the QUEUED status and did not progress to completion despite multiple monitoring attempts. This prevented me from generating conformers and obtaining computed ADMET descriptors through the Rowan platform.\n\n### Paclitaxel Structure Analysis\nThe SMILES string obtained for paclitaxel is:\n`CC(=O)O[C@H]1C(=O)[C@]2(C)[C@@H](O)C[C@H]3OC[C@@]3(OC(C)=O)C2[C@H](OC(=O)c4ccccc4)[C@]5(O)C[C@H](OC(=O)[C@H](O)[C@@H](NC(=O)c6ccccc6)c7ccccc7)C(=C1C5(C)C)C`\n\nThis complex molecule contains:\n- Multiple stereocenters (indicated by @ symbols)\n- Ester groups (acetyl and benzoyl)\n- A baccatin core structure\n- Phenyl groups\n- Molecular weight: ~854 Da\n\n### ADMET Properties Analysis (Based on Known Properties)\n\n#### Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability\n**Key Finding:** Paclitaxel is known to have **poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability** due to several physicochemical properties:\n\n1. **Molecular Size**: With a molecular weight of ~854 Da, paclitaxel significantly exceeds the typical BBB permeability threshold of 400-500 Da\n2. **Lipophilicity**: While the molecule contains hydrophobic regions (phenyl groups, acetyl groups), the overall structure with multiple polar functional groups results in moderate lipophilicity\n3. **Hydrogen Bonding**: Multiple hydrogen bond donors and acceptors (hydroxyl groups, carbonyls, amide) contribute to poor membrane permeability\n4. **Efflux Transporters**: Paclitaxel is a known substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporters, which actively pump it out of brain tissue\n\n#### Other ADMET Properties\n- **Solubility**: Poor aqueous solubility requiring formulation with Cremophor EL/surfactants\n- **Metabolism**: Extensive hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4 and CYP2C8\n- **Protein Binding**: High plasma protein binding (>95%)\n- **Elimination**: Primarily biliary excretion with enterohepatic recirculation\n- **Toxicity**: Known for peripheral neuropathy, myelosuppression, and hypersensitivity reactions\n\n### Clinical Implications\nThe poor BBB permeability of paclitaxel explains why:\n1. It is ineffective against primary brain tumors\n2. High systemic doses are required for therapeutic effect\n3. Alternative formulations (nab-paclitaxel) have been developed to improve delivery\n4. Research continues on BBB-penetrating taxane analogs\n\n### Recommendations for Future Analysis\nDue to the workflow queuing issues encountered, I recommend:\n1. Retrying the conformer search with a simplified approach\n2. Using alternative computational methods for ADMET prediction\n3. Considering smaller molecule analogs for BBB permeability studies\n\nThis analysis demonstrates the significant challenges in achieving CNS penetration with large, complex natural product-derived molecules like paclitaxel.", "tools_called": ["mcp_rowan_molecule_lookup", "mcp_rowan_submit_conformer_search_workflow", "mcp_rowan_submit_descriptors_workflow", "mcp_rowan_workflow_get_status", "mcp_rowan_retrieve_workflow"], "correctness": null, "notes": ""}
