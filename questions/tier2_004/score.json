Correctly determines dominant form at pH 7.4 is monocationic species with protonated amine (~53% vs expected ~80%) and neutral phenolic OH. Sound chemical reasoning throughout."

      "notes": "Major error in protonation state analysis. Claims nitrogen is deprotonated at pH 7.4 (pKa 7.26), but when pH > pKa, weak bases are deprotonated while weak acids are protonated. For morphine's tertiary amine (weak base), pH 7.4 < pKa 7.26 means it should be predominantly protonated (~58% based on Henderson-Hasselbalch). Expected answer shows ~80% protonation. The pKa values are within reasonable ranges (N: 7.26 vs expected 8.0; phenolic OH: 10.27 vs expected 9.9), and correctly identifies single tautomeric form, but the fundamental misunderstanding of acid-base chemistry makes the conclusion incorrect."

Correctly identified single dominant tautomeric form due to rigid structure. pKa values are within expected ranges: tertiary amine ~7.35 (cf. expected 8.0), phenolic OH ~10.42 (cf. expected 9.9). Correctly determined monocationic species dominates at pH 7.4 with protonated amine and neutral phenolic OH. Provided additional valuable details including macroscopic pKa values and logD analysis."

Correctly determined that at pH 7.4, the dominant form is the monocationic species with protonated amine (80.49%) and neutral phenolic OH. The macroscopic pKa analysis and microstate distribution provide additional valuable detail beyond the expected answer."

While correctly identifies canonical structure dominance, the protonation state analysis is fundamentally wrong."

Correctly identifies single tautomeric form but misses the critical tertiary amine pKa (~8.0) entirely."
