Values are within reasonable computational uncertainty compared to experimental literature values. Chemical reasoning is sound, correctly identifying benzene as difficult to oxidize/reduce. Used valid computational method (r2SCAN-3c/CPCM) which is acceptable alternative to experimental determination."

Reduction potential of -3.52 V is closer but still outside range (expected -3.42 \u00b1 0.05 V, difference of -0.10 V exceeds uncertainty). While computational method is reasonable, the numerical deviations are too significant to be within typical experimental uncertainty."

The computational methodology is sound, but the reduction potential error is too large to consider correct."
