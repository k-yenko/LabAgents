      "notes": "Response shows proper methodology by identifying paracetamol structure and submitting appropriate computational workflows, but fails to provide any actual results due to API communication issues. No numerical values for HOMO/LUMO energies, dipole moment, or geometry optimization results are reported. While the approach is sound, the complete absence of calculated electronic properties means the question requirements are not met."

While optimization energy and molecular descriptors are provided, the core electronic properties (HOMO/LUMO energies, dipole moment value) that were specifically requested are missing."

      "notes": "Response shows computational workflow execution but fails to provide the required numerical results. No HOMO/LUMO energies, dipole moment values, or conformational analysis reported. Only mentions global electrophilicity indices (~1.0646, ~0.6276) and acknowledges that explicit HOMO/LUMO energies and dipole values were not successfully extracted from the calculations. Expected values include dipole moment of 2.28 Debye and identification of stable conformations PAM1/PAM2."

      "correct": true,

      "notes": "Response provides reasonable electronic properties: HOMO -6.02 eV, LUMO -1.38 eV, gap 4.64 eV, dipole 3.12 D. While using GFN2-xTB instead of B3LYP/6-31G+(d,p), this is a valid computational method. The dipole moment differs from reference (3.12 D vs 2.28 D) but falls within reasonable uncertainty for different methods. Chemical structure and optimization approach are sound."

All key electronic properties requested were calculated and reported."
