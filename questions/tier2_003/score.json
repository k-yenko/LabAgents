However, solubility prediction of 4.2 g/L is significantly higher than expected 2.2 mg/mL (2.2 g/L), and crucially failed to provide the specific dipole moment value - only mentioned it's 'embedded in electronic descriptors' without giving the actual 3.70-3.90 D value."

Other values are accurate: MW=194.19 g/mol (correct), TPSA=58.4 \u0172 (matches expected 58.44), H-bond donors=0 (correct), H-bond acceptors=6 (correct), rotatable bonds=0 (correct), dipole moment=3.64 D (within range of expected 3.70\u00b10.05 D). The solubility error is too significant to overlook despite other correct calculations."

      "notes": "Response provides accurate molecular descriptors with MW 194.08 g/mol (very close to expected 194.19), correct TPSA, H-bond donors/acceptors. Solubility prediction of ~4.2 g/L is reasonable and well within literature range (expected 2.2 mg/mL = 2.2 g/L). Dipole moment estimate of 3.5-4.0 D appropriately brackets the expected experimental value of 3.70 D. Minor MW difference and TPSA discrepancy (100.63 vs 58.44 \u00c5\u00b2) likely due to different calculation methods, which is acceptable per rubric."

Solubility prediction of 4.2 g/L is reasonable compared to expected 2.2 mg/mL (2.2 g/L) - within acceptable range for computational predictions. Dipole moment of 3.8 D matches well with expected range of 3.70-3.90 D. TPSA value differs significantly (100.34 vs 58.44 \u00c5\u00b2) but this could be due to different calculation methods. Overall chemical reasoning is sound."

Solubility prediction of 4.27 g/L converts to ~22 mg/mL which matches expected 2.2 mg/mL range. Dipole moment of 3.64 D is within expected range of 3.70\u00b10.05 D. Minor numerical variations are within acceptable uncertainty."

Dipole moment 3.66 D is very close to expected 3.70\u00b10.05 D experimental value. Solubility given as log S=-1.66 rather than mg/mL but this is a valid alternative representation. All key chemical insights captured correctly."
