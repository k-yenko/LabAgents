Docking workflow failed completely, missing all binding kinetics data (Kd, k\u2082, binding efficiency). While solubility predictions were provided, they don't match expected temperature-dependent data format. Molecular weight close but slightly off (334.099 vs 334.39). Missing critical \u03b2-lactam ring strain analysis and bond order information."

Missing critical structural analysis of \u03b2-lactam ring strain and N4-C7 bond order. Docking score -4.732 provided but lacks essential kinetic parameters (Kd, k\u2082, binding efficiency). No discussion of resistance mechanisms. While molecular weight (334.099 vs 334.39) and some descriptors are reasonable, the response fails to meet key technical requirements."

Docking scores provided but don't correspond to expected quantitative binding data. Chemical reasoning is sound but numerical values fall outside acceptable literature ranges for key descriptors."
