Here are the predicted solubility values for caffeine in water at the three specified temperatures:\n\n### Results:\n\n| Temperature | Temperature (K) | log S (mol/L) | Uncertainty | Solubility (mol/L) | Solubility (g/L) |\n|------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| 25\u00b0C | 298.15 K | -1.663 \u00b1 0.073 | \u00b10.073 | 0.0217 | 4.22 |\n| 37\u00b0C | 310.15 K | -1.460 \u00b1 0.076 | \u00b10.076 | 0.0347 | 6.74 |\n| 50\u00b0C | 323.15 K | -1.243 \u00b1 0.080 | \u00b10.080 | 0.0571 | 11.09 |\n\n*Note: Molecular weight of caffeine (C\u2088H\u2081\u2080N\u2084O\u2082) = 194.19 g/mol*\n\n### Temperature Dependence Analysis:\n\n1. **Clear Positive Temperature Dependence**: The solubility of caffeine in water increases significantly with temperature, showing a positive correlation.\n\n2. **Quantitative Increase**:\n   - From 25\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C (12\u00b0C increase): Solubility increases by ~60% (from 4.22 to 6.74 g/L)\n   - From 37\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C (13\u00b0C increase): Solubility increases by ~65% (from 6.74 to 11.09 g/L)\n   - Overall from 25\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C (25\u00b0C increase): Solubility increases by ~163% (2.6-fold increase)\n\n3. **Log-Linear Relationship**: The log S values show a nearly linear increase with temperature:\n   - Change in log S per degree: approximately 0.017 units per Kelvin\n   - This suggests an exponential relationship between solubility and temperature\n\n4. **Practical Implications**:\n   - Hot coffee/tea (\u224850\u00b0C) can dissolve ~2.6 times more caffeine than room temperature water\n   - Body temperature (37\u00b0C) water dissolves ~1.6 times more caffeine than room temperature\n   - This explains why hot water extraction is more efficient for brewing caffeinated beverages\n\n### Thermodynamic Interpretation:\n\nThe positive temperature dependence indicates that the dissolution of caffeine in water is an endothermic process (\u0394H_solution > 0), consistent with the need to break intermolecular forces in the solid caffeine crystal lattice. The increasing solubility with temperature follows the Le Chatelier's principle for endothermic dissolution processes.", "tools_called": ["mcp_rowan_molecule_lookup", "mcp_rowan_submit_solubility_workflow", "mcp_rowan_workflow_wait_for_result"], "correctness": null, "notes": ""}

The log S values increase linearly with temperature, indicating that caffeine follows typical behavior where higher temperatures enhance solubility due to increased molecular motion and thermal energy overcoming intermolecular forces.\n\nThe solubility approximately doubles every ~15\u00b0C temperature increase, demonstrating strong temperature sensitivity that is important for pharmaceutical and beverage applications.
