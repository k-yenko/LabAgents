The 25\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C predictions are roughly 2x higher than expected, while the 50\u00b0C prediction is significantly lower than expected. However, the temperature dependence trend is correctly identified as positive."

Values are within reasonable computational uncertainty ranges and show correct increasing trend with temperature. Chemical reasoning about thermal energy and molecular motion is sound."

The 50\u00b0C value falls well outside the expected range, and overall temperature dependence is underestimated."

Converting logS=-1.66 gives ~0.22 mg/mL at 25\u00b0C, which is 10x lower than expected 2.2 mg/mL.
