### 1. Warfarin Tautomer-pKa Relationship [tier3_001]

**Question**: Find the major tautomers of warfarin, calculate the pKa for each tautomeric form, identify the dominant form at pH 7.4, then predict its protein binding affinity

**Expected**: Warfarin exhibits 40 distinct tautomeric forms via prototropic and ring-chain tautomerism, with T4S (open-chain) most stable in gas phase at 0.0 kcal/mol and T10S_R (cyclic hemiketal) most stable in aqueous solution. The pKa of the coumarin 4-hydroxyl group is 5.05-5.2, making the deprotonated anionic form dominant at pH 7.4. Protein binding to human serum albumin is 99% at Sudlow Site I in subdomain IIA, with crystal structure available at 2.5 Ã… resolution.
