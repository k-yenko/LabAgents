# How to Validate Real Failures (Avoiding Judge Bias)

## üö® The Problem You Identified

**Current state**:
- Claude judge scores all evaluations
- Claude models: 95-100% pass rate
- OpenAI o3: 13.6% pass rate
- **This is suspicious** - likely same-family bias

**Your question**: "Aren't my failures biased? How do I ensure failures are actually failures?"

**Answer**: YES, they're biased. Here's how to find REAL failures.

---

## ‚úÖ Method 1: Ground Truth Validation (Objective, No Judge Needed)

**Principle**: You don't need a judge to check if a number is correct.

### **Step 1: Create Simple Ground Truth File** (30 min)

```json
// data/ground_truth_simple.json
{
  "tier1_002": {
    "question": "Calculate pKa of acetic acid",
    "molecule": "acetic acid",
    "expected_value": 4.76,
    "acceptable_range": [4.2, 5.2],
    "source": "Experimental consensus value"
  },
  "tier1_003": {
    "question": "Calculate logP of aspirin",
    "molecule": "aspirin",
    "expected_value": 1.19,
    "acceptable_range": [0.8, 1.5],
    "source": "PubChem CID 2244"
  },
  "tier1_004": {
    "question": "Calculate pKa of benzoic acid",
    "molecule": "benzoic acid",
    "expected_value": 4.20,
    "acceptable_range": [3.8, 4.6],
    "source": "Experimental literature"
  }
  // Add 5-10 most common questions with KNOWN experimental values
}
```

### **Step 2: Automated Correctness Check** (1 hour)

```python
# scripts/validate_against_ground_truth.py

## ‚úÖ Method 2: Manual Spot Check (Human Ground Truth)

**Principle**: YOU are the ground truth for 5-10 cases.

### **Step 1: Pick 10 Random Evaluations** (5 min)

```python
# scripts/sample_for_manual_review.py

import json, glob, random

all_evals = glob.glob('evaluations/*/json/*_evaluation.json')
sample = random.sample(all_evals, 10)

for eval_file in sample:
    with open(eval_file, 'r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)

    # Get corresponding log
    question_id = data['question_id']
    model_name = eval_file.split('/')[-1].replace('_evaluation.json', '')
    log_file = f"logs/{question_id}/{model_name}/{model_name}_*.json"

    print(f"\n{'='*80}")
    print(f"Question: {question_id}")
    print(f"Model: {model_name}")
    print(f"Judge Score: {data['total_score']}/6 ({data['overall_assessment']})")
    print(f"Log: {glob.glob(log_file)[0] if glob.glob(log_file) else 'NOT FOUND'}")
    print(f"Eval: {eval_file}")
```

### **Step 2: Review Each Case as Expert** (2 hours)

For each of the 10 samples, YOU manually decide:

```markdown
# analysis/manual_spot_check.md

## Sample 1: tier1_002 - acetic acid pKa
**Model**: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
**Judge Score**: 6/6 (pass)

### Agent's Answer
"The calculated pKa is 4.82 using DFT B3LYP/6-31G*"

### Literature Check
- Expected pKa: 4.76 (consensus experimental)
- Error: 0.06 units (1.3% error)

### YOUR Assessment
- ‚úÖ **CORRECT** - Within experimental error
- ‚úÖ **Judge agreed** - Gave 2/2 for correctness

**Verdict**: AGREEMENT ‚úì

---

## Sample 2: tier1_001 - remdesivir solubility
**Model**: openai/o3
**Judge Score**: 2/6 (fail)

### Agent's Answer
"Unable to complete calculation. Workflow timed out after 300s."

### Check Agent Log
- Agent submitted workflow
- Checked status once at 60s
- Saw "running"
- Gave up immediately
- Never retrieved results

### Literature Check
- Expected: 0.339 mg/mL
- Agent's answer: None (incomplete)

### YOUR Assessment
- ‚úó **INCOMPLETE** - Agent gave up too early
- ‚úÖ **Judge agreed** - Gave 0/2 for completion

**Verdict**: AGREEMENT ‚úì

---

## Sample 3: tier2_003 - aspirin pKa
**Model**: openai/o3
**Judge Score**: 1/6 (fail)

### Agent's Answer
"The calculated pKa is 3.47 using DFT"

### Literature Check
- Expected pKa: 3.49 (experimental)
- Error: 0.02 units (0.6% error)

### YOUR Assessment
- ‚úÖ **CORRECT** - Excellent accuracy!
- ‚úó **Judge DISAGREED** - Gave 0/2 for correctness

### Judge's Reasoning
"Agent's value of 3.47 deviates from literature value of 3.5"

### YOUR Analysis
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **FALSE NEGATIVE** - Judge too strict
- Agent was extremely accurate (0.02 units off)
- Judge possibly using rounded literature value (3.5 vs 3.49)
- **BIAS INDICATOR**: Is judge harsher on o3?

**Verdict**: JUDGE ERROR - False negative ‚úó

---

## Sample 4: tier1_005 - ibuprofen logP
**Model**: anthropic/claude-opus-4
**Judge Score**: 5/6 (pass)

### Agent's Answer
"Calculated logP = 4.2 using XLogP3"

### Literature Check
- Expected logP: 3.97 (PubChem)
- Error: 0.23 units (5.8% error)

### YOUR Assessment
- ‚úÖ **ACCEPTABLE** - Within typical ML error (¬±0.3)
- ‚úÖ **Judge agreed** - Gave 2/2 for correctness

**Verdict**: AGREEMENT ‚úì

---

## Sample 5: tier2_001 - caffeine pKa
**Model**: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
**Judge Score**: 6/6 (pass)

### Agent's Answer
"The calculated pKa is 10.2"

### Literature Check
- Expected pKa: 10.4 (experimental)
- Error: 0.2 units (1.9% error)

### YOUR Assessment
- ‚úÖ **CORRECT** - Good accuracy
- ‚úÖ **Judge agreed** - Gave 2/2

**Verdict**: AGREEMENT ‚úì

---

## Sample 6: tier1_007 - compound X
**Model**: google/gemini-2.5-pro
**Judge Score**: 3/6 (fail)

### Agent's Answer
"Calculated pKa = 8.9"

### Literature Check
- Expected pKa: 7.2 (experimental)
- Error: 1.7 units (23.6% error)

### YOUR Assessment
- ‚úó **INCORRECT** - Too far off
- ‚úÖ **Judge agreed** - Gave 0/2 for correctness

**Verdict**: AGREEMENT ‚úì

---

## Sample 7: tier3_002 - complex molecule
**Model**: openai/gpt-4o
**Judge Score**: 2/6 (fail)

### Agent's Answer
"Calculated solubility = 0.045 mg/mL"

### Literature Check
- Expected: 0.12 mg/mL (experimental)
- Error: 0.075 mg/mL (62.5% error)

### YOUR Assessment
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **BORDERLINE** - Within ML model error range (¬±50-100%)
- ‚úó **Judge DISAGREED** - Gave 0/2 for correctness

### YOUR Analysis
- Judge used ¬±50% threshold
- Actual error: 62.5% (just outside threshold)
- This is TECHNICALLY correct by rubric
- But: Is ¬±50% threshold too strict for ML solubility models?

**Verdict**: AGREEMENT (but rubric may be too strict) ‚ö†Ô∏è

---

## Sample 8: tier1_003 - aspirin logP
**Model**: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
**Judge Score**: 6/6 (pass)

### Agent's Answer
"Calculated logP = 1.25 using XLogP3"

### Literature Check
- Expected logP: 1.19 (PubChem)
- Error: 0.06 units (5% error)

### YOUR Assessment
- ‚úÖ **CORRECT** - Excellent
- ‚úÖ **Judge agreed** - Gave 2/2

**Verdict**: AGREEMENT ‚úì

---

## Sample 9: tier2_005 - molecule Y pKa
**Model**: openai/o3
**Judge Score**: 4/6 (pass)

### Agent's Answer
"Calculated pKa = 5.1"

### Literature Check
- Expected pKa: 6.8 (experimental)
- Error: 1.7 units (25% error)

### YOUR Assessment
- ‚úó **INCORRECT** - Significant error
- ‚úó **Judge DISAGREED** - Gave 1/2 for correctness

### YOUR Analysis
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **FALSE POSITIVE** - Judge too lenient
- 1.7 units is >1.5 unit threshold ‚Üí should be 0/2
- Judge gave 1/2 (partial credit)
- **BIAS INDICATOR**: Is judge giving o3 benefit of doubt?

**Verdict**: JUDGE ERROR - False positive ‚úó

---

## Sample 10: tier1_004 - benzoic acid pKa
**Model**: google/gemini-2.5-pro
**Judge Score**: 5/6 (pass)

### Agent's Answer
"Calculated pKa = 4.15 using DFT"

### Literature Check
- Expected pKa: 4.20 (experimental)
- Error: 0.05 units (1.2% error)

### YOUR Assessment
- ‚úÖ **CORRECT** - Excellent
- ‚úÖ **Judge agreed** - Gave 2/2

**Verdict**: AGREEMENT ‚úì
```

### **Step 3: Calculate Your Agreement**

```
MANUAL SPOT CHECK RESULTS (10 samples)
======================================

Agreement: 7/10 (70%)
  ‚úì Judge agreed with human: 7 cases
  ‚úó Judge disagreed: 3 cases

Disagreements:
  False Negatives: 1 (tier2_003 - o3 aspirin pKa)
  False Positives: 1 (tier2_005 - o3 molecule Y pKa)
  Rubric too strict: 1 (tier3_002 - gpt-4o solubility)

Bias Indicators:
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Sample 3: Judge harsh on o3 (false negative)
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Sample 9: Judge lenient on o3 (false positive)
  ‚Üí Inconsistent, need more data

Claude models in sample: 4/4 agreements (100%)
OpenAI models in sample: 2/4 agreements (50%)
Google models in sample: 2/2 agreements (100%)

‚ö†Ô∏è  TENTATIVE BIAS: Judge may be harsher on OpenAI models
‚úÖ  SAMPLE TOO SMALL: Need 20-30 samples for confidence
```

## ‚úÖ Method 3: Cross-Judge Validation

**Principle**: If multiple judges disagree with each other on the SAME log, there's no ground truth - it's subjective.

### **Run 2-3 Other Judges on Same Logs** (2 hours)

```bash
# Run GPT-4o judge on ALL existing logs

## üéØ How to Use These Methods

### **Priority Order**:

1. **Ground Truth Validation** (DO THIS FIRST - 2 hours)
   - Create ground truth for 5-10 common questions
   - Run automated comparison
   - Identify objective failures vs judge bias
   - **This gives you confidence in WHAT is actually wrong**

2. **Manual Spot Check** (DO THIS SECOND - 2 hours)
   - Review 10 random cases as human expert
   - Calculate your agreement with judge
   - Identify systematic bias patterns
   - **This calibrates your trust in the judge**

3. **Cross-Judge Validation** (OPTIONAL - 4 hours)
   - Only if budget allows (~$10-20 for 200 evals √ó 2 judges)
   - Identifies subjective cases (judges disagree)
   - Quantifies same-family bias
   - **This is overkill for now, but useful later**

## ‚úÖ What You'll Learn

After running these validations:

### **Scenario A: Judge is mostly correct** (70-80% agreement with ground truth)
‚Üí Trust the failures, proceed with error analysis
‚Üí Focus on fixing agent issues, not judge issues

### **Scenario B: Judge has systematic bias** (50-60% agreement, patterns by model family)
‚Üí Fix judge rubric FIRST before analyzing failures
‚Üí Relax thresholds or add better examples to prompt
‚Üí Re-run evaluations with improved judge

### **Scenario C: Judge is unreliable** (<50% agreement)
‚Üí Don't trust ANY judge scores yet
‚Üí Focus on ground truth validation only
‚Üí Build better rubric from scratch

## üöÄ Start Today (2 Hours)

```bash
# Hour 1: Create ground truth + automated validation
# 1. Pick 5 questions you KNOW the answer to
# 2. Add to data/ground_truth_simple.json
# 3. Run validation script
python scripts/validate_against_ground_truth.py

# Hour 2: Manual spot check
# 1. Sample 10 random evaluations
# 2. For each: check agent answer vs literature yourself
# 3. Document where you agree/disagree with judge
```

**After 2 hours, you'll know**:
- ‚úÖ What % of failures are REAL vs judge bias
- ‚úÖ Whether same-family bias is significant
- ‚úÖ Whether to trust Claude judge or fix it first

**This answers your question**: "How do I ensure failures are actually failures?"

**Answer**: By validating against objective ground truth, not another LLM. üéØ
